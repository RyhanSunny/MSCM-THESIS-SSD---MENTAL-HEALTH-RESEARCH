# SSD Causal Effect Study - Validation Analysis Log
**Date**: May 25, 2025  
**Analyst**: Ryhan Suny  
**Status**: CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED - REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive validation analysis has been conducted on the SSD causal effect pipeline (scripts 01-06). The analysis revealed a **critical discrepancy** in the exposure definition that must be resolved before any further analysis can proceed.

## Critical Finding: Exposure Definition Discrepancy

### The Issue
- **Blueprint Specification**: AND logic (all three criteria must be met)
  - Results: 199 exposed patients (0.08% of cohort)
- **Current Implementation**: OR logic (any one criterion qualifies)  
  - Results: 143,579 exposed patients (55.9% of cohort)
- **Discrepancy Factor**: 721x difference

### Evidence
1. **Blueprint** (SSD THESIS final METHODOLOGIES blueprint (1).md):
   > "For primary analysis, patients must meet ALL of the following to be considered exposed"

2. **Implementation** (02_exposure_flag.py, lines 202-207):
   ```python
   exposure["exposure_flag"] = (
       exposure.crit1_normal_labs |  # Should be &
       exposure.crit2_sympt_ref   |  # Should be &
       exposure.crit3_drug_90d
   )
   ```

## Validation Analyses Attempted

### 1. Charlson Validation
- **Script**: `analysis/charlson_validation/charlson_validation.py`
- **Status**: Created but not executed due to environment issues
- **Purpose**: Validate comorbidity index calculations

### 2. Exposure Validation  
- **Script**: `analysis/exposure_validation/exposure_validation.py`
- **Status**: Created but not executed due to environment issues
- **Purpose**: Analyze exposure pattern distributions and overlaps

### 3. Autoencoder Validation
- **Script**: `analysis/autoencoder_validation/autoencoder_validation.py`
- **Status**: Created but not executed due to environment issues
- **Purpose**: Validate severity index performance

### 4. Utilization Validation
- **Script**: `analysis/utilization_validation/utilization_validation.py`
- **Status**: Created but not executed due to environment issues
- **Purpose**: Compare healthcare utilization between groups

### 5. Combined Summary
- **Script**: `analysis/combined_validation_summary.py`
- **Status**: Created but not executed due to environment issues
- **Purpose**: Integrate all validation findings

## Technical Challenges Encountered

1. **Python Environment**: Virtual environment lacks required packages (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy)
2. **Package Installation**: Timeouts during pip install prevented proper setup
3. **Workaround**: Created ASCII-based visualizations and reports using standard library

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. CRITICAL - Resolve Exposure Definition (Week 1)
- [ ] Convene emergency team meeting
- [ ] Review clinical rationale for AND vs OR logic
- [ ] Consult similar SSD studies for precedent
- [ ] Make definitive decision with justification
- [ ] Update study protocol with decision

### 2. Fix Implementation (Week 1)
If AND logic is chosen:
```python
# In 02_exposure_flag.py
exposure["exposure_flag"] = exposure["exposure_flag_strict"]
```

If OR logic is justified:
- Document clinical rationale
- Update blueprint to match implementation
- Consider both as primary/sensitivity analyses

### 3. Re-run Affected Scripts (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Re-execute scripts 02-06 with correct definition
- [ ] Validate output consistency
- [ ] Update derived data files

### 4. Complete Validation Analyses (Week 2)
- [ ] Set up proper Python environment
- [ ] Run all validation scripts
- [ ] Generate publication-quality figures
- [ ] Compile final validation report

## Impact on Study Timeline

| Phase | Original | Revised | Impact |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|
| Exposure Resolution | N/A | Week 1 | +1 week |
| Script Re-execution | N/A | Week 1-2 | +1 week |
| PS Matching | Week 3 | Week 3-4 | +1 week |
| Causal Analysis | Week 4-5 | Week 5-6 | +1 week |
| Sensitivity | Week 6 | Week 7-8 | +2 weeks |
| **Total Delay** | - | - | **+6 weeks** |

## Recommendations

1. **Primary Recommendation**: Use AND logic as specified in blueprint for clinical validity
2. **Alternative**: If sample size too small (n=199), consider:
   - Relaxing to 2-of-3 criteria
   - Using OR logic with clear justification
   - Analyzing both as co-primary analyses

3. **Autoencoder Improvement**: 
   - Current AUROC (0.588) needs enhancement
   - Target interim milestone of 0.70
   - Consider alternative architectures

## Conclusion

The exposure definition discrepancy represents a **fundamental threat to study validity**. With a 721-fold difference in exposed population between implementations, the entire causal inference framework changes. This must be resolved before any further progress can be made.

**Study Status**: ⛔ BLOCKED - Awaiting exposure definition resolution
