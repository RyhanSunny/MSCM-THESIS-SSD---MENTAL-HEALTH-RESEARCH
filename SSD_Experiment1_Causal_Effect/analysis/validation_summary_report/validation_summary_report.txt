VALIDATION SUMMARY REPORT

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================

This validation analysis integrates findings from the SSD causal effect pipeline
to identify critical issues that must be addressed before proceeding with the
causal analysis.

CRITICAL ISSUE: EXPOSURE DEFINITION DISCREPANCY
==============================================

The most significant finding is a fundamental discrepancy between the blueprint
specification and the actual implementation of the exposure definition:

- Blueprint Specification: AND logic (all three criteria must be met)
  * Results in 199 exposed patients (0.08% of cohort)
  
- Current Implementation: OR logic (any one criterion qualifies)  
  * Results in 143,579 exposed patients (55.9% of cohort)

This represents a 721-fold difference in the exposed population size.

EXPOSURE CRITERIA BREAKDOWN
==========================

The three SSD exposure criteria are:

1. H1 - Normal Labs Pattern: ~85,000 patients
   - Multiple normal lab results with persistent symptoms
   
2. H2 - Referral Loops: ~42,000 patients  
   - Circular referral patterns between specialists
   
3. H3 - Medication Persistence: ~67,000 patients
   - Long-term use of symptom-relief medications

Only 199 patients meet ALL THREE criteria (AND logic).

IMPLICATIONS
============

1. Study Power: The AND logic cohort (n=199) may be too small for robust
   causal inference, especially after propensity score matching.

2. Clinical Validity: The OR logic may capture a heterogeneous population
   with different SSD phenotypes, while AND logic identifies severe cases.

3. Generalizability: Results will differ substantially based on the chosen
   definition, affecting external validity.

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============

1. IMMEDIATE: Convene research team meeting to decide on exposure definition
   - Consider clinical input on appropriate criteria
   - Review similar studies for precedent
   - Document rationale for final decision

2. ANALYSIS PLAN:
   - Primary analysis with chosen definition
   - Sensitivity analysis with alternative definition
   - Subgroup analyses by criteria combinations

3. AUTOENCODER IMPROVEMENT:
   - Current performance (AUROC 0.588) needs enhancement
   - Consider feature engineering and architecture changes

4. VALIDATION ANALYSES:
   - Run comprehensive validation scripts once environment is set up
   - Generate visualizations for manuscript
   - Perform statistical tests on group differences

NEXT STEPS
==========

1. Resolve exposure definition (CRITICAL - blocks all downstream work)
2. Set up Python environment with required packages
3. Run validation analyses with corrected definition
4. Update study protocol with decisions and rationale
5. Proceed with propensity score matching (script 05)
