# **SSD Study: Research Question, Hypotheses, and Pipeline‚ÄìHypothesis Mapping**
# **UPDATED June 30, 2025 - Post Reviewer Feedback Implementation**

## Research Question (RQ) - Mental Health Population
**In a cohort of mental health patients (n=256,746), does exposure to somatic symptom disorder (SSD) patterns‚Äîcharacterized by repeated normal diagnostic results, unresolved specialist referrals, and persistent psychotropic medication use‚Äîcausally increase mental health service utilization and emergency department visits, and can a composite SSD severity index mediate this relationship within this homogeneous mental health population?**

## Detailed Hypothesis Suite

| ID | Statement | Key Variables | Expected Direction / Effect Size | Planned Test | Implementation Status |
|----|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| **H1 ‚Äî MH Diagnostic Cascade** | In MH patients, ‚â•3 normal lab panels within 12-month exposure window causally increase subsequent healthcare encounters (primary care + mental health visits) over 24 months. | Exposure: binary flag for normal-lab cascade (n=112,134, 43.7%); Outcome: count of all healthcare encounters (Poisson) | IRR ‚âà 1.35‚Äì1.50 | Poisson/negative-binomial regression after 1:1 PS-matching; over-dispersion check (Œ±). | ‚úÖ Ready with Rubin's pooling |
| **H2 ‚Äî MH Specialist Referral Loop** | In MH patients, ‚â•2 unresolved specialist referrals (NYD status) predict mental health crisis services or psychiatric emergency visits within 6 months. | Exposure: referral loop flag (n=1,536, 0.6%); Outcome: MH crisis/psychiatric ED visits (binary) | OR ‚âà 1.60‚Äì1.90 | PS-matched logistic regression; falsification with resolved referrals as negative control. | ‚ùå No MH crisis/psychiatric ED identification |
| **H3 ‚Äî MH Medication Persistence** | In MH patients, >90 consecutive days of psychotropic medications (anxiolytic/antidepressant/hypnotic) predict emergency department visits in next year. | Exposure: psychotropic persistence (n=51,218, 19.9%); Outcome: any ED visit (binary) | aOR ‚âà 1.40‚Äì1.70 | Multivariable logistic model with IPW; E-value for unmeasured confounding. | ‚úÖ Ready with weight trimming |
| **H4 ‚Äî MH SSD Severity Mediation** | In MH patients, the SSDSI (range 0-100, mean=0.80) mediates ‚â•55% of total causal effect of H1-H3 exposures on healthcare utilization costs (proxy estimates based on encounter counts) at 24 months. | Mediator: continuous SSDSI in MH population; Outcome: total healthcare costs (proxy estimates) (gamma GLM) | Proportion mediated ‚â•0.55 | Causal mediation (DoWhy) with 5K bootstraps; sensitivity to sequential ignorability. | ‚úÖ Framework implemented |
| **H5 ‚Äî MH Effect Modification** | The causal effect of SSD-pattern exposure on healthcare utilization differs across predefined high‚Äêrisk MH subgroups (anxiety, age < 40, female sex, high baseline utilization); at least two subgroups will show a statistically stronger effect (interaction p < 0.05). | Subgroups: binary flags in master table; Outcome: interaction term in weighted regression | ‚â•2 significant Œ≤_interaction terms (FDR < 0.05) | Interaction analysis in `06_causal_estimators.py` + FDR correction | ‚úÖ Ready with ESS monitoring |
| **H6 ‚Äî MH Clinical Intervention** | In high-SSDSI MH patients, integrated care with somatization-focused interventions reduces predicted utilization by ‚â•25% vs. usual mental health care. | Intervention: integrated MH-PC care; Outcome: predicted utilization reduction | Œî ‚â• -25% (95% CI excludes 0) | G-computation using validated SSDSI + published effect sizes for integrated MH care. | ‚úÖ Framework implemented |

**Conceptual Flow for Mental Health Population:**
1. Pre-existing mental health vulnerability ‚Üí enhanced somatic awareness and health anxiety
2. Repetitive normal diagnostics ‚Üí diagnostic uncertainty ‚Üí amplified anxiety in MH patients
3. Unresolved referrals & persistent psychotropic medications reinforce somatic preoccupation
4. MH-calibrated SSDSI aggregates these patterns with higher baseline severity
5. Mental health symptoms amplify SSD patterns, driving escalating MH service utilization
6. Crisis presentations emerge from unresolved somatic-psychiatric symptom interactions

**Alignment with RQ:**
- RQ1 (causal link): H1‚ÄìH3 (PS/weighting for exchangeability)
- RQ2 (mediator role): H4
- RQ3 (actionability): H6

## **Key Improvements Implemented (June 30, 2025)**

### 1. ‚úÖ **Critical Pipeline Fix - Imputation Order**
- **Problem**: Pipeline was imputing on 19-column cohort instead of full 73-column dataset
- **Solution**: Created `pre_imputation_master.py` to merge all features BEFORE imputation
- **Impact**: Dramatically improves imputation quality by using all available information

### 2. ‚úÖ **Barnard-Rubin Degrees of Freedom Adjustment**
- **Problem**: Missing small-sample adjustment for Rubin's Rules
- **Solution**: Implemented full Barnard-Rubin (1999) adjustment in `rubins_pooling_engine.py`
- **Impact**: More accurate confidence intervals for finite samples

### 3. ‚úÖ **Increased Imputation Count**

- **Solution**: Corrected to ESS = sum(w)¬≤ / sum(w¬≤) in `weight_diagnostics_visualizer.py`
- **Impact**: Accurate weight diagnostics and instability detection

### 6. ‚úÖ **Weight Trimming Implementation**
- **Problem**: No handling of extreme propensity scores
- **Solution**: Implemented Crump et al. (2009) rule in `06_causal_estimators.py`

### 7. ‚úÖ **MC-SIMEX Variance Limitation Documentation**
- **Problem**: No warning about MC-SIMEX not integrating with MI variance
- **Solution**: Created `docs/STATISTICAL_LIMITATIONS.md`
- **Impact**: Transparent documentation of statistical limitations

### 8. ‚úÖ **Git SHA + Timestamp in Results**
- **Problem**: Missing version control information in outputs
- **Solution**: Added git metadata to all YAML outputs via `git_utils.py`
- **Impact**: Full reproducibility and audit trail

### 9. ‚úÖ **CI Environment Dependencies**
- **Problem**: Missing matplotlib and other packages
- **Solution**: Updated `requirements.txt` and `environment.yml`
