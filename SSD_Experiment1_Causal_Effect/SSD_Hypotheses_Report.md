## 1. What We're Studying {#overview}

### The Mental Health Context
**Key Discovery**: All 256,746 patients in our dataset are mental health patients, not a general population. This finding required complete reframing of our research approach to focus on mental health-specific outcomes and interventions.

### Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) in Mental Health Patients
Somatic symptom disorders are particularly common and complex in mental health populations. Patients with pre-existing anxiety, depression, and other psychiatric conditions often experience heightened somatic awareness and may develop SSD patterns that interact with their underlying mental health conditions.

### Why This Matters for Mental Health Care
Understanding SSD patterns in mental health patients is crucial because:
- **Enhanced vulnerability**: Mental health patients are more susceptible to somatic preoccupation
- **Complex interactions**: Physical symptoms and psychiatric symptoms often reinforce each other
- **Treatment challenges**: Standard approaches may not address the somatic-psychiatric interface
- **Resource utilization**: MH patients with SSD patterns may drive disproportionate healthcare use

## 2. Our Research Hypotheses (Mental Health Population) {#hypotheses}

We're testing six main hypotheses about how SSD patterns affect healthcare utilization in mental health patients:

### **H1-MH: Mental Health Diagnostic Cascade**
**"In MH patients, repeated normal lab tests lead to increased mental health service utilization"**

- **What we're testing**: ≥3 normal lab panels within 12 months → increased MH service encounters
- **Why it matters**: Normal results may increase health anxiety in vulnerable MH patients
- **Expected effect**: IRR ≈ 1.40–1.55 (higher than general population due to anxiety amplification)
- **Clinical significance**: Early identification of diagnostic cascade patterns

### **H2-MH: Mental Health Specialist Referral Loop**  
**"In MH patients, unresolved specialist referrals predict mental health crises"**

- **What we're testing**: ≥2 unresolved specialist referrals → MH crisis services or psychiatric ED visits
- **Why it matters**: Medical uncertainty may trigger psychiatric symptom exacerbation
- **Expected effect**: OR ≈ 2.20–2.80 (amplified in MH population)
- **Clinical significance**: Preventing crisis through integrated care coordination

### **H3-MH: Psychotropic Medication Persistence**
**"In MH patients, prolonged psychotropic medication use predicts emergency visits"**

- **What we're testing**: >90 days psychotropic medications → ED visits within next year
- **Why it matters**: Complex medication regimens may indicate treatment-resistant symptoms
- **Expected effect**: aOR ≈ 1.80–2.20 (higher due to polypharmacy complexity)
- **Clinical significance**: Medication optimization and monitoring

### **H4-MH: SSD Severity Index Mediation in Mental Health**
**"SSD severity mediates the relationship between exposures and outcomes in MH patients"**

- **What we're testing**: MH-calibrated SSDSI mediates ≥55% of causal effects
- **Why it matters**: Quantifies how much SSD severity explains the exposure-outcome relationship
- **Expected effect**: Proportion mediated ≥0.55 (higher than general population)
- **Clinical significance**: Validates severity index for MH population targeting

### **H5-MH: Effect Modification in Mental Health Subgroups**
**"Effects are amplified in high-risk mental health subgroups"**

- **What we're testing**: Effects stronger in anxiety disorders, age <40, female sex, substance use
- **Why it matters**: Identifies highest-risk MH phenotypes for targeted intervention
- **Expected effect**: 2-3x amplification in high-risk subgroups
- **Clinical significance**: Precision mental health care targeting

### **H6-MH: Integrated Mental Health-Primary Care Intervention**
**"Integrated care reduces utilization in high-severity MH patients"**

- **What we're testing**: Integrated MH-PC care → ≥25% utilization reduction in high-SSDSI patients
- **Why it matters**: Tests effectiveness of coordinated care model
- **Expected effect**: Δ ≥ -25% utilization reduction
- **Clinical significance**: Evidence for health system transformation
