# ROBINS-I Risk of Bias Assessment

## Study: Causal Effect of Somatic Symptom Patterns on Healthcare Utilization

### Domain 1: Bias due to confounding

**Signaling questions:**
1. Is there potential for confounding? **Yes**
2. Was the analysis adjusted for all important confounders? **Yes**
   - Age, sex, Charlson index, rural/urban, province
3. Were confounders measured reliably? **Yes**
4. Did the authors control for post-exposure variables? **No**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Comprehensive confounder adjustment using propensity scores with good balance achieved (SMD < 0.1)

### Domain 2: Bias in selection of participants

**Signaling questions:**
1. Was selection into the study unrelated to intervention and outcome? **Yes**
2. Do start of follow-up and intervention coincide? **Yes**
3. Were adjustment techniques used to correct for selection bias? **N/A**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Population-based cohort with clear inclusion/exclusion criteria

### Domain 3: Bias in classification of interventions

**Signaling questions:**
1. Were intervention groups clearly defined? **Yes**
2. Was the information used to define interventions recorded at start of follow-up? **Yes**
3. Could classification have been affected by knowledge of the outcome? **No**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Exposure defined using objective EHR data prior to outcome assessment

### Domain 4: Bias due to deviations from intended interventions

**Signaling questions:**
1. Were there deviations from intended intervention beyond what would be expected in usual practice? **No**
2. Were these deviations unbalanced between groups? **N/A**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Observational study of usual care patterns

### Domain 5: Bias due to missing data

**Signaling questions:**
1. Were outcome data available for all participants? **No**
2. Were participants excluded due to missing outcome data? **Yes, minimal**
3. Are the proportion and reasons for missing data similar across groups? **Yes**
4. Is there evidence that results were robust to missing data? **Yes**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low to Moderate**

**Rationale:** Multiple imputation used for missing covariates; <5% missing outcomes

### Domain 6: Bias in measurement of outcomes

**Signaling questions:**
1. Could the outcome measure have been influenced by knowledge of intervention? **No**
2. Were outcome assessors aware of the intervention received? **N/A**
3. Were the methods of outcome assessment comparable across groups? **Yes**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Objective outcomes from administrative data

### Domain 7: Bias in selection of reported results

**Signaling questions:**
1. Is the reported effect estimate likely to be selected from multiple measurements? **No**
2. Is the reported effect estimate likely to be selected from multiple analyses? **No**
3. Is the reported effect estimate selected from different subgroups? **No**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Pre-specified analysis plan; all planned analyses reported

## Overall Risk of Bias

**Overall judgment:** **Low to Moderate**

**Summary:** The study has low risk of bias in most domains. The main concern is potential residual confounding from unmeasured factors (e.g., symptom severity), addressed through E-value sensitivity analysis.
