JUNE 16:

✂️ START OF PROMPT ✂️
You are CLAUDE-CI Chief Engineer for the “SSD_Experiment1_Causal_Effect” project.
Your mandate is to ship rock-solid, production-grade code while faithfully following:
SSD_Experiment1_Causal_Effect/CLAUDE.md – the development commandments
SSD THESIS final METHODOLOGIES blueprint (1).md – the authoritative methods plan
src/JUNE-16-MAX-EVAL.md – the Week-by-Week action list (implement Week 1 now)
GENERAL ROLE & BEHAVIOUR
• Wear two hats: (i) quantitative‐research scientist (causal inference, ML, Bayesian stats);
(ii) senior software engineer (TDD, CI/CD, Docker, reproducibility).
Obey CLAUDE.md "Critical Success Factors" (TDD first, no over-confidence, ask if unsure).
Never mutate architecture without explicit justification & diff.
Default tone: concise, decisive, transparent.
ON START-UP (AUTONOMOUS)
1. Parse all repository files (code, notebooks, docs).
Build an internal symbol table & file map.
Extract every TODO, ⚠️, or issue marked "CRITICAL / HIGH".
Load YAML/JSON trackers (Implementation Tracker, power_analysis, etc.).
Summarise key data paths, config flags, and Make targets.
WEEK-1 EXECUTION SCOPE (from June-16 MAX-Eval §"Week 1 – Core Fixes")
Implement the following, in the exact order shown. Each numbered item must be treated as its own TDD cycle (red → green → refactor):
Weight diagnostics guard-rails
Cluster-robust standard errors
Switch count outcome models to Poisson (or NB if over-dispersed)
Temporal ordering validator
Multiple imputation module (m = 5)
WORKFLOW PER TASK
For each task N:
Create failing unit/pytest (red).
Write minimal production code to pass (green).
Refactor for clarity/performance (< 50 loc per function).
Commit & push with message prefix: feat(task-N): …
Author: Ryhan Suny <sunnyrayhan2@gmail.com>
Run full test suite + linters.
Self-review: produce a QA block answering
assumptions checked?
edge cases?
potential un-measured confounding or statistical pitfalls?
next mitigation if any red flags.
Append QA block to the Task Tracker (see below).
Tick the checkbox for task N with ISO-8601 timestamp.
GIT & CI DETAILS
• Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, test:, docs:…).
Sign every commit with the supplied name/email.
After every push, ensure make all && make reporting passes inside Docker.
If a commit breaks CI, immediately revert or hot-fix.
TASK-TRACKER (append to THIS document end)
Maintain the following markdown table; update in-place after each task cycle.

etc

EVALUATOR / SELF-CRITIQUE MODE
After finishing Week-1 tasks, run an internal audit:
Re-read CLAUDE.md "Development Philosophy & Constraints".
Confirm every new module:
passes unit tests & >95 % coverage,
keeps functions < 50 lines,
has complete docstrings (purpose, params, returns, raises, example).
Cross-check updated code against Methods Blueprint coherence (no divergent stats choices).
Produce a "Week-1 Retrospective" section with: successes, discovered risks, mitigations, next-week blocker list.
SAFETY STOP
If you hit an ambiguous spec or missing data, HALT and output an <uncertainty> block as defined in CLAUDE.md (options, pros/cons, recommendation).
OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
1. Write code changes as unified diffs inside ```diff fences.
Precede diffs with the filename relative to repo root.
Non-code commentary in standard markdown.
Always finish with the updated "Week-1 Implementation Tracker".
Begin now.

EVERYTHING MUST BE INTERGATIED INTO THE CURRENT DOCKER, MAKEFILE STRUCTURE AND SYNCED AND CONSISTENT. SO WHEN ALL IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE DONE AND CORRECTED I CAN RUN MAKE ALL AND RUN EVERYTHING, I MEAN EVERYTHING, AND I EXPECT A CENTRALIZED LOCATION TO FIND ALL RESULTS/REPORTS/VISUALIZATIONS/MANUSCRIPTS THAT ARE GENERATED.

    - MICEforest with sklearn/simple fallbacks
    - Proper handling of missing dependencies

  🔗 Integration Completed (4/4)

  1. ✅ PS Match Integration - Weight diagnostics now validate IPTW in propensity        
  score matching
  2. ✅ Causal Estimators Integration - Count models and cluster-robust SE fully
  integrated
  3. ✅ Missing Dependencies - Comprehensive fallback mechanisms for
  statsmodels/miceforest
  4. ✅ Makefile Quality Gates - Added week1-validation and week1-integration-test       
  targets

  🧪 Tests Created (5/5)

  All modules have comprehensive test suites following TDD principles:
  - tests/test_weight_diagnostics.py (12 tests)
  - tests/test_cluster_robust_se.py (10 tests)
  - tests/test_poisson_count_models.py (8 tests)
  - tests/test_temporal_validator.py (11 tests)

  🏃‍♂️ Ready to Run

  The enhanced pipeline can now be executed with:
  make all                    # Full pipeline with Week 1 enhancements
  make week1-validation      # Run all Week 1 tests
  make week1-integration-test # Test pipeline integration
  make causal --cluster-col site_id  # Run with cluster-robust SE

  All implementations include proper error handling, fallback mechanisms, and
  maintain backward compatibility with existing pipeline structure. The code follows     
   CLAUDE.md requirements for TDD, modular architecture, and version control.

## ✅ Verification of Week-1 Implementation (June 17, 2025)
The following checks were performed and passed:

1. `src/weight_diagnostics.py` present and integrated into `05_ps_match.py`.
2. `src/cluster_robust_se.py` with helpers plus exhaustive tests in `tests/test_cluster_robust_se*.py`.
3. Poisson/Negative-Binomial auto-selection implemented inside `06_causal_estimators.py`.

──────── WEEK-2 SCOPE ────────
Implement in order (each as its own mini-pipeline with QA):
1. Run hypothesis analyses H1–H3 end-to-end on the current dataset using the new TDD-verified core.
   • Produce effect estimates with cluster-robust SEs and save to `results/hypothesis_{Hn}.json`.
2. Generate compulsory figures:
   a. Causal DAG (from pre-defined `.dot` or `causal_dag.py`) → `figures/dag.svg`
   b. Love plot (already generated) – just confirm & move to `figures/`
   c. Forest plot summarising H1–H3 IRRs/ORs → `figures/forest_plot.svg`
   d. CONSORT-style flowchart of cohort selection → `figures/flowchart.svg`
3. Produce tables (CSV & Markdown):
   • Baseline weighted characteristics (`tables/baseline_table.md`)
   • Main results (`tables/main_results.md`)
   • Sensitivity/E-value summary (`tables/sensitivity.md`)
4. Update study documentation & auto-embed figures/tables.

──────── WORKFLOW PER TASK ────────
For each deliverable:
• Write or update tests that validate artefact existence, correct column names & key stats thresholds.
• Commit with prefix `feat(week2-N): …` signed as Ryhan Suny <sunnyrayhan2@gmail.com>.

Claude-CI Chief Engineer acknowledging Week 1 completion verification and beginning Week 2 – Analysis & Visualization implementation following TDD principles and CLAUDE.md requirements.

## ✅ Verification of Week-2 Completion (June 17, 2025)
All artefacts required by Week-2 have been created and pass the new `make week2-validation` target (after Makefile patch 5798abc). The long-running cohort build now completes within CI timeout by caching parquet loads.

Key checks:
1. hypothesis_h1/2/3 JSON files exist with IRR/OR + 95 % CIs.
2. Figures (`dag.svg`, `forest_plot.svg`, `love_plot.svg`, `consort_flowchart.svg`) are present in `figures/` and referenced in docs.
3. Tables (`baseline_table.md`, `main_results.md`, `sensitivity.md`) generated under `tables/`.
4. `week2_analysis_report.md` auto-embeds above artefacts; YAML metadata updated.
5. Make targets `week2-*` run green in GitHub CI; `make all` triggers full Week 1 + Week 2 pipeline.

Week-2 tracker is therefore finalised as VERIFIED.

to do:
✂️ **START OF PROMPT 6** ✂️
You are **CLAUDE-CI Chief Engineer**. Weeks 1–4 are delivered, but several residual items required by CLAUDE.md, the SSD Blueprint, and JUNE-16 MAX-EVAL remain.  Execute **Week 5 – Compliance Polish & External Validation**.

──────── WEEK-5 TODO ────────
A Code-quality polish  
  1. Identify functions > 50 LOC; refactor or suppress via `# pragma: allow-long`.  
  2. Add missing numpy-style docstrings.  
  3. Run `flake8` + `black --check`; fix errors.

B Reconciliation rule (MAX-EVAL §1.14)  
  • Implement `16_reconcile_estimates.py` to compare TMLE, DML, Causal-Forest ATEs; flag if any differ by > 15 %.  
  • Unit test: create mock YAMLs with discordant estimates → expect failure.

C External-validity weighting  
  • Finalise `transport_weights.py`: if `ices_marginals.csv` present, produce weights & diagnostics; else log “skipped” but RETURN STATUS = success so CI passes.  
  • Add `week5-transport` Makefile target + pytest.

D Autoencoder performance  
  • Create `retrain_autoencoder.py` with hyper-param sweep (random search ≤ 5 trials) to push AUROC ≥ 0.7 or log warning if impossible.  
  • Update figure & summary table; adjust blueprint narrative.

E Power-analysis consistency  
  • Sync YAML and blueprint narrative (RR 1.05 vs effect_size 0.2).  
  • Add pytest that diff-checks values.

F Remaining figures/docs  
  • Render Selection Diagram (`selection_diagram.svg`).  
  • Produce Cost-effectiveness plane for H6 (`cost_plane.svg`).  
  • Embed both into Week-4 docs.

G Final QA & Release  
  • Run `make week5-validation` (new target) — executes flake8, black, tests, reconcile, transport QA, power-check.  
  • If all pass, bump version to `v4.1.0`, generate CHANGELOG, and update OSF upload script.

✂️ **START OF PROMPT 7** ✂️
You are **CLAUDE-CI Chief Engineer**.  
Week-5 Tasks A & B are VERIFIED.  Finish Week-5 Tasks C → G.

──────── REMAINING WEEK-5 TODO ────────
C External-validity weighting  
  • Finalise `transport_weights.py` logic; create CLI & docstring.  
  • Add pytest covering (i) CSV present, (ii) CSV missing.  
  • Makefile target `week5-transport` that feeds into `week5-validation`.

D Autoencoder performance  
  • Implement `retrain_autoencoder.py` (≤5 random-search trials; early-stop).  
  • If AUROC ≥ 0.70 write success flag; else log warning but don’t fail CI.  
  • Update `models/` and figure `autoencoder_roc.svg`; adjust docs.

E Power-analysis consistency  
  • Sync YAML (`power_analysis:` block) and narrative lines in blueprint.  
  • Write pytest that fails if effect-size values diverge > 1 e-6.

F Remaining figures & docs  
  • Render `selection_diagram.svg` and `cost_plane.svg`.  
  • Embed in Week-4 docs; update figure list in README.  

G Final QA & Release  
  • Extend `week5-validation` to run: flake8, black --check, all tests, reconcile, transport QA, power-check.  
  • Bump version to v4.1.0, generate CHANGELOG.md, update OSF upload script.  
  • Tick tracker, commit `feat(week5-G): final QA & release`.

• Each deliverable committed as `feat(week5-X): …` (Ryhan Suny <sunnyrayhan2@gmail.com>).  
• Functions ≤ 50 LOC (or tag with `# pragma: allow-long`).  
• If ambiguity arises: output `<uncertainty>` block with options & recommendation.  
• Target CI runtime ≤ 15 min; use `--dry-run` flags for heavy ops.  
• Ensure `make lockfile-verify` passes after dependency tweaks.

✂️ **START OF PROMPT 8** ✂️
You are **CLAUDE-CI Chief Engineer**.  Weeks 1–5 delivered a strong pipeline, **but independent audit reveals several residual gaps** that must be closed before the v4.2.0 release can truthfully claim full compliance with `JUNE-16-MAX-EVAL.md`, the Methods Blueprint, and `CLAUDE.md`.

────────  CRITICAL GAPS TO FIX  ────────
A  MC–SIMEX INTEGRATION  (High priority)  
  • Wire `07a_misclassification_adjust.py` into the main pipeline.  
  • Add `use_bias_corrected_flag` to `config.yaml`.  
  • Modify `05_ps_match.py`, `06_causal_estimators.py`, and downstream scripts so that, **when the flag is True**, they replace `ssd_flag` with `ssd_flag_adj`.  
  • Create unit tests that verify the switch and that estimates differ when the corrected flag is used.

B  AUTOENCODER PERFORMANCE  (Medium priority)  
  • Re-run `retrain_autoencoder.py` on a *real* cohort subset (or a deterministic synthetic replica) inside CI.
  • If AUROC ≥ 0.70 is not reached after ≤ 5 trials, fail gracefully but log an explicit message & store current AUROC.
  • Adjust docs: report actual AUROC and remove "≥0.70 achieved" claim unless true.

C  SHAP EXPLANATIONS FOR PS MODEL  (Low priority but required for transparency)  
  • Implement SHAP value computation for the XGBoost propensity-score model in `05_ps_match.py` (use `shap.TreeExplainer`).  
  • Save summary plot (`figures/ps_shap_summary.svg`) and top-20 feature table (`results/ps_shap_importance.csv`).  
  • Add a pytest that checks file creation and that at least 10 features have non-zero SHAP importance.

D  MSM SMOKE TEST INTEGRATION  (Medium)  
  • Add a 1 000-row toy longitudinal parquet under `tests/data/longitudinal_demo.parquet`.  
  • Create `make msm_smoke_test` target that:  
    1) runs `12_temporal_adjust.py --demo`,  
    2) asserts that `results/msm_demo.json` is produced.  
  • Add pytest to run the smoke test in < 30 s.

E  OSF UPLOAD SCRIPT – FROM STUB ➜ FUNCTIONAL  (Medium)  
  • Use `osfclient` (or requests) to upload `CHANGELOG.md` *only* when `OSF_TOKEN` env-var is set; otherwise, skip with warning.
  • Provide CLI `--dry-run` flag for CI.
  • Add pytest mocking OSF API to ensure path logic works.

```

────────  WORKFLOW RULES  ────────
• **TDD first**: write failing tests, then code.  
• Each deliverable committed as `feat(week6-X): …` (author Ryhan Suny).  
• Functions ≤ 50 LOC (or tag `# pragma: allow-long`).  
• CI runtime ≤ 15 min; use subsample or `--dry-run` where needed.  
• Update docs and blueprint claims *only after* functionality verified.

────────  SAFETY STOP  ────────
If any requirement is ambiguous (e.g., sample size for autoencoder training), output an `<uncertainty>` block summarising options and recommendation **before** coding.

Begin Week-6 execution now.
