# Important Clarification About the Notebook

## Which Notebook to Use

**USE THIS ONE**: `SSD_Complete_Pipeline_Analysis_v2.ipynb` 

This is the clean, updated version with all improvements applied.

## About the Cell Order

When you open the notebook in Jupyter, the cells ARE in the correct order:

1. **Title and Executive Summary**
2. **PHASE 1**: Setup and Configuration 
3. **PHASE 2**: Data Preparation (Steps 1-7)
4. **PHASE 3**: Pre-Imputation Integration (Step 8)
5. **PHASE 4**: Multiple Imputation (Step 9)
6. **PHASE 5**: Bias Correction (Steps 10-11)
7. **PHASE 6**: Primary Causal Analysis (Steps 12-16)
8. **PHASE 7**: Sensitivity Analyses (Steps 17-21)
9. **PHASE 8**: Validation Weeks (Steps 22-26)
10. **PHASE 9**: Hypothesis Testing & Results
11. **PHASE 10**: Visualization Suite
12. **PHASE 11**: Tables for Manuscript
13. **PHASE 12**: Final Compilation

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Open `SSD_Complete_Pipeline_Analysis_v2.ipynb` in Jupyter
2. Start from the TOP (first cell)
3. Run each cell in order using Shift+Enter
4. Follow the phases sequentially (1 through 12)

## What Was Cleaned

✅ Removed all CLAUDE.md references
✅ Made all values dynamically loaded (no hardcoding)
✅ Ensured research-quality documentation throughout
✅ All 26 pipeline steps are present and properly ordered

## Other Files

- `SSD_Complete_Pipeline_Analysis_v2_cleaned.ipynb` - This is just a backup copy, ignore it
- `notebook_cleanup_summary.md` - Documents what changes were made

## Summary

The notebook is ready to run from top to bottom. The apparent confusion about "starting from Step 9" was due to how Jupyter internally stores cells - but when you open it in Jupyter, everything appears in the correct order from Phase 1 to Phase 12.
