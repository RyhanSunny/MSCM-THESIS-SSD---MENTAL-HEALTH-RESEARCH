EXPOSURE DEFINITION IMPACT ANALYSIS
===================================

Scenario Analysis:
                     OR Logic    AND Logic    Difference
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Exposed Patients     143,579     199          721x
Unexposed Patients   113,167     256,547      2.3x
Power for Analysis   HIGH        VERY LOW     Critical
Heterogeneity        HIGH        LOW          Significant
Clinical Validity    Questionable Specific    Important

Implications for Causal Analysis:
• OR Logic: Large heterogeneous group, high power, unclear clinical meaning
• AND Logic: Small homogeneous group, low power, clear clinical meaning
• Decision needed: Clinical validity vs. statistical power trade-off
