# **SSD Study: Research Question, Hypotheses, and Pipeline–Hypothesis Mapping**
# *UPDATED July 1, 2025*

## Research Question (RQ)
**In a cohort of mental health patients (n=256,746), does exposure to somatic symptom disorder (SSD) patterns—characterized by repeated normal diagnostic results, unresolved specialist referrals, and persistent psychotropic medication use—causally increase healthcare utilization, and can a composite SSD severity index mediate this relationship within this homogeneous mental health population?**

## Detailed Hypothesis Suite

| ID | Statement | Key Variables | Expected Direction / Effect Size | Planned Test | Implementation Status |
|----|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| **H1 — Diagnostic Cascade** | In MH patients, ≥3 normal lab panels within 12-month exposure window causally increase subsequent healthcare encounters over 24 months. | Exposure: binary flag for normal-lab cascade (n=112,134, 43.7%); Outcome: count of all healthcare encounters (Poisson) | IRR ≈ 1.35–1.50 | Poisson/negative-binomial regression after 1:1 PS-matching; over-dispersion check (α). | ✅ Ready with Rubin's pooling |
| **H2 — Specialist Referral Loop** | In MH patients, ≥2 unresolved specialist referrals (proxy: repeated referrals) predict increased healthcare utilization within 6 months. | Exposure: referral loop flag (n=1,536, 0.6%); Outcome: healthcare utilization + ED visits (binary) | OR ≈ 1.60–1.90 | PS-matched logistic regression; falsification with resolved referrals as negative control. | ⚠️ MISALIGNED - IN PROGRESS |
| **H3 — MH Medication Persistence** | In MH patients, >180 consecutive days of psychotropic medications (anxiolytic/antidepressant/hypnotic) predict HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION in next year. | Exposure: psychotropic persistence (n=51,218, 19.9%); Outcome: healthcare utilization + ED visits (binary) | aOR ≈ 1.40–1.70 | Multivariable logistic model with IPW; E-value for unmeasured confounding. | ✅ Ready with weight trimming |
| **H4 — MH SSD Severity Mediation** | In MH patients, the SSDSI (range 0-100, mean=0.80) mediates ≥55% of total causal effect of H1-H3 exposures on healthcare utilization costs (proxy estimates based on encounter counts) at 24 months. | Mediator: continuous SSDSI in MH population; Outcome: total healthcare costs (proxy estimates) (gamma GLM) | Proportion mediated ≥0.55 | Causal mediation (DoWhy) with 5K bootstraps; sensitivity to sequential ignorability. | ✅ Framework implemented |
| **H5 — MH Effect Modification** | The causal effect of SSD-pattern exposure on healthcare utilization differs across predefined high‐risk MH subgroups (anxiety, age < 40, female sex, high baseline utilization); at least two subgroups will show a statistically stronger effect (interaction p < 0.05). | Subgroups: binary flags in master table; Outcome: interaction term in weighted regression | ≥2 significant β_interaction terms (FDR < 0.05) | Interaction analysis in `06_causal_estimators.py` + FDR correction | ✅ Ready with ESS monitoring |
| **H6 — MH Clinical Intervention** | In high-SSDSI MH patients, integrated care with somatization-focused interventions reduces predicted utilization by ≥25% vs. usual mental health care. | Intervention: integrated MH-PC care; Outcome: predicted utilization reduction | Δ ≥ -25% (95% CI excludes 0) | G-computation using validated SSDSI + published effect sizes for integrated MH care. | ✅ Framework implemented |

**⚠️ H2 Implementation Note:**
Dr. Karim's suggested causal chain specifies: NYD → referred to specialist → "no diagnosis of that body part"

**NYD Pattern Identification Strategy:**
We identify "Not Yet Diagnosed" (NYD) patterns using ICD-9 codes 780-799 (symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions), which represent diagnostic uncertainty regardless of referral outcomes. Our data shows:
- Code 799 (symptoms/signs): 177,653 codes (1.42%) in 58,285 patients
- Codes 780-789 (symptom range): 867,700 codes (6.96%) in 214,774 patients (60.99%)

**Data Considerations:**
1. While we cannot directly verify "unresolved" status in referrals, we can track diagnostic uncertainty through:
   - Repeated referrals to same specialty (proxy for unresolved issues)
   - Persistence of symptom codes (780-799) after referrals
   - Continued normal lab patterns indicating no organic findings
2. Primary care data - cannot identify MH-specific crisis services or psychiatric ED visits
3. Can only identify generic ED visits via EncounterType field

**Solution**: Three-tier proxy implementation:
- Tier 1: Current - Any specialist referrals with symptom codes 
- Tier 2: Enhanced - NYD codes (780-799) + specialist referrals 
- Tier 3: Full proxy - NYD + ≥3 normal labs + repeated specialist referrals 

Outcome: General healthcare utilization and ED visits (not MH-specific)
Reference: Rosendal et al. (2017) validates repeated referrals as diagnostic uncertainty proxy.

**Conceptual Flow for Mental Health Population:**
1. Pre-existing mental health vulnerability → enhanced somatic awareness and health anxiety
2. Repetitive normal diagnostics → diagnostic uncertainty → amplified anxiety in MH patients
3. Unresolved referrals & persistent psychotropic medications reinforce somatic preoccupation
4. MH-calibrated SSDSI aggregates these patterns with higher baseline severity
5. Mental health symptoms amplify SSD patterns, driving escalating MH service utilization
6. Crisis presentations emerge from unresolved somatic-psychiatric symptom interactions

**Alignment with RQ:**
- RQ1 (causal link): H1–H3 (PS/weighting for exchangeability)
- RQ2 (mediator role): H4
- RQ3 (actionability): H6

## **Key Improvements Implemented (July 1, 2025)**

### ✅ **Missing Lab Index Date Solution**
- **Problem**: 28.3% of patients have no lab records, causing missing IndexDate_lab
- **Solution**: Hierarchical index dates in `01_cohort_builder.py` (lab → MH encounter → psychotropic)
- **Impact**: All patients now have valid index dates; enables phenotype analysis

### ✅ **H2 Hypothesis Alignment**
- **Problem**: Current H2 tracks symptom referrals, not true "unresolved" status
- **Solution**: Three-tier implementation in `02_exposure_flag.py` (basic, NYD+referrals, full proxy)
- **Impact**: Better alignment with Dr. Karim's causal chain

### ✅ **Datetime Imputation Fix**
- **Problem**: Datetime columns causing imputation errors
- **Solution**: Exclude datetime columns in `07b_missing_data_master.py`
- **Impact**: Pipeline completes successfully

## **Key Improvements Implemented (June 30, 2025)**

### 1. ✅ **Critical Pipeline Fix - Imputation Order**
- **Problem**: Pipeline was imputing on 19-column cohort instead of full 73-column dataset
- **Solution**: Created `pre_imputation_master.py` to merge all features BEFORE imputation
- **Impact**: Dramatically improves imputation quality by using all available information

### 2. ✅ **Barnard-Rubin Degrees of Freedom Adjustment**
- **Problem**: Missing small-sample adjustment for Rubin's Rules
- **Solution**: Implemented full Barnard-Rubin (1999) adjustment in `rubins_pooling_engine.py`

- **Solution**: Updated to m=30 imputations in config
- **Impact**: Better uncertainty quantification following Rubin's recommendation



### 4. ✅ **ESS (Effective Sample Size) Formula Correction**
- **Problem**: Incorrect ESS formula with erroneous n× factor
- **Solution**: Corrected to ESS = sum(w)² / sum(w²) in `weight_diagnostics_visualizer.py`
- **Impact**: Accurate weight diagnostics and instability detection

### 5. ✅ **Weight Trimming Implementation**
- **Problem**: No handling of extreme propensity scores
- **Solution**: Implemented Crump et al. (2009) rule in `06_causal_estimators.py`
- **Impact**: Improved stability of weighted analyses

### 6. ✅ **MC-SIMEX Variance Limitation Documentation**
- **Problem**: No warning about MC-SIMEX not integrating with MI variance
- **Solution**: Created `docs/STATISTICAL_LIMITATIONS.md`
- **Impact**: Transparent documentation of statistical limitations

### 7. ✅ **Git SHA + Timestamp in Results**
- **Problem**: Missing version control information in outputs
- **Solution**: Added git metadata to all YAML outputs via `git_utils.py`
- **Impact**: Full reproducibility and audit trail

5. **Causal Forest**: Currently runs on full dataset using CPU (all cores). Future: GPU acceleration for faster computation
6. **Long COVID**: Zero cases in pre-pandemic data. Future: 2020+ data analysis
7. **Missing Lab Index Dates**: 28.3% patients have no lab records. Addressed via hierarchical index dates (see `docs/FINAL_TODO_LIST_IndexDate_Implementation.md`)
