## Study Design

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) database. The study followed STROBE-CI reporting guidelines for causal inference studies.

### Population

The study population consisted of primary care patients aged ≥18 years with at least 30 months of follow-up data. We excluded patients with:
- Charlson comorbidity index >5
- Palliative care codes
- Opt-out status

Final cohort: N=250,025 patients

## Exposure Definition

Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) patterns were identified using a multi-criteria algorithm:

1. **Normal laboratory cascade**: ≥3 normal lab results within 90 days
2. **Unresolved referrals**: Referral codes without resolution (NYD codes)
3. **Psychotropic medication patterns**: Continuous use ≥90 days
4. **High healthcare utilization**: >75th percentile encounters

## Statistical Analysis

### Propensity Score Methods

We estimated propensity scores using gradient boosting (XGBoost) with the following covariates:
- Age (continuous)
- Sex (binary)
- Charlson comorbidity index (0-5)
- Rural/urban status
- Province
- Baseline healthcare utilization

```python
# Propensity score estimation
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

ps_model = XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=4,
    learning_rate=0.1,
    objective='binary:logistic'
)
ps_model.fit(X_confounders, treatment)
propensity_scores = ps_model.predict_proba(X_confounders)[:, 1]
```

### Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW)

Weights were calculated as:
- Treated: 1/PS
- Control: 1/(1-PS)

Weights were trimmed at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce extreme values.

### Outcome Models

For count outcomes (healthcare encounters), we used Poisson regression with robust standard errors:

```python
# Poisson regression for count outcomes
import statsmodels.api as sm

poisson_model = sm.GLM(
    y_outcome,
    X_weighted,
    family=sm.families.Poisson(),
    freq_weights=weights
)
results = poisson_model.fit(cov_type='HC0')
```

## Causal Inference Methods

### Assumptions

1. **Exchangeability**: No unmeasured confounding
2. **Positivity**: 0 < P(Treatment|Confounders) < 1
3. **Consistency**: Well-defined treatment
4. **No interference**: SUTVA holds

### Sensitivity Analyses

1. E-value calculation for unmeasured confounding
2. Multiple imputation for missing data (m=5)
3. Alternative exposure definitions (OR vs AND logic)
4. Varying follow-up periods

## Code Snippets

### Weight Diagnostics

```python
def calculate_effective_sample_size(weights):
    '''Calculate Kish's effective sample size'''
    return np.sum(weights)**2 / np.sum(weights**2)

def validate_weights(weights):
    '''Ensure weights are not extreme'''
    ess = calculate_effective_sample_size(weights)
    ess_ratio = ess / len(weights)
    
    if ess_ratio < 0.5:
        raise ValueError(f"ESS too low: {ess_ratio:.2%}")
    
    max_weight_ratio = np.max(weights) / np.median(weights)
    if max_weight_ratio > 10:
        raise ValueError(f"Extreme weights detected: {max_weight_ratio:.1f}x median")
```

### Cluster-Robust Standard Errors

```python
def cluster_robust_se(model, cluster_ids):
    '''Calculate cluster-robust standard errors'''
    from statsmodels.stats.sandwich_covariance import cov_cluster
    
    cov_matrix = cov_cluster(model, cluster_ids)
    return np.sqrt(np.diag(cov_matrix))
```

## Software

All analyses were conducted using:
- Python 3.12
- R 4.3.0
- Key packages: pandas, numpy, statsmodels, xgboost, scikit-learn

## Study: Causal Effect of Somatic Symptom Patterns on Healthcare Utilization

### Domain 1: Bias due to confounding

**Signaling questions:**
1. Is there potential for confounding? **Yes**
2. Was the analysis adjusted for all important confounders? **Yes**
   - Age, sex, Charlson index, rural/urban, province
3. Were confounders measured reliably? **Yes**
4. Did the authors control for post-exposure variables? **No**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Comprehensive confounder adjustment using propensity scores with good balance achieved (SMD < 0.1)

### Domain 2: Bias in selection of participants

**Signaling questions:**
1. Was selection into the study unrelated to intervention and outcome? **Yes**
2. Do start of follow-up and intervention coincide? **Yes**
3. Were adjustment techniques used to correct for selection bias? **N/A**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Population-based cohort with clear inclusion/exclusion criteria

### Domain 3: Bias in classification of interventions

**Signaling questions:**
1. Were intervention groups clearly defined? **Yes**
2. Was the information used to define interventions recorded at start of follow-up? **Yes**
3. Could classification have been affected by knowledge of the outcome? **No**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Exposure defined using objective EHR data prior to outcome assessment

### Domain 4: Bias due to deviations from intended interventions

**Signaling questions:**
1. Were there deviations from intended intervention beyond what would be expected in usual practice? **No**
2. Were these deviations unbalanced between groups? **N/A**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Observational study of usual care patterns

### Domain 5: Bias due to missing data

**Signaling questions:**
1. Were outcome data available for all participants? **No**
2. Were participants excluded due to missing outcome data? **Yes, minimal**
3. Are the proportion and reasons for missing data similar across groups? **Yes**
4. Is there evidence that results were robust to missing data? **Yes**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low to Moderate**

**Rationale:** Multiple imputation used for missing covariates; <5% missing outcomes

### Domain 6: Bias in measurement of outcomes

**Signaling questions:**
1. Could the outcome measure have been influenced by knowledge of intervention? **No**
2. Were outcome assessors aware of the intervention received? **N/A**
3. Were the methods of outcome assessment comparable across groups? **Yes**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Objective outcomes from administrative data

### Domain 7: Bias in selection of reported results

**Signaling questions:**
1. Is the reported effect estimate likely to be selected from multiple measurements? **No**
2. Is the reported effect estimate likely to be selected from multiple analyses? **No**
3. Is the reported effect estimate selected from different subgroups? **No**

**Risk of bias judgment:** **Low**

**Rationale:** Pre-specified analysis plan; all planned analyses reported

## Overall Risk of Bias

**Overall judgment:** **Low to Moderate**

**Summary:** The study has low risk of bias in most domains. The main concern is potential residual confounding from unmeasured factors (e.g., symptom severity), addressed through E-value sensitivity analysis.
