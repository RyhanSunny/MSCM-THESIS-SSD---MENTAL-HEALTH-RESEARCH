Generated: 2025-06-17 10:34:01

## Executive Summary

This report documents the completion of Week 4 enhancements to the SSD (Somatic Symptom Disorder) causal inference pipeline, achieving full mental health domain alignment as specified in the study blueprint. The enhanced pipeline now properly analyzes a cohort of mental health patients (target n=256,746) with mental health-specific exposures and outcomes.

## 1. Mental Health Cohort Enhancement

### 1.1 Population Definition
The study cohort has been refined to focus specifically on mental health patients using ICD diagnosis codes:

**Inclusion Criteria:**
- ICD-10: F32-F48 (depressive, anxiety, stress-related, somatoform disorders)
- ICD-9: 296.* (affective psychoses), 300.* (anxiety/neurotic disorders)

**Quality Metrics:**
- Target cohort size: n=256,746
- Minimum MH prevalence: ≥60% of total cohort
- Automated validation with CI failure if thresholds not met

### 1.2 Enhanced Exposure Definitions

#### H1: Normal Laboratory Cascade (Unchanged)
Maintained existing laboratory-based SSD identification

#### H2: Psychiatric Referral Loop Patterns (Enhanced)
- Expanded specialty classification (psychiatry, psychology, behavioral health, addiction)
- Loop pattern: ≥2 unresolved psychiatric referrals
- Enhanced tracking of referral outcomes and care coordination failures

#### H3: Psychiatric Drug Persistence (Enhanced)
- **Duration threshold:** Increased from 90 to 180 days (6 months)
- **Enhanced drug classes:**
  - N06A: Antidepressants (SSRI, SNRI, tricyclic, MAOI, others)
  - N03A: Anticonvulsants (mood/anxiety indications)
  - N05A: Antipsychotics (typical and atypical)
- **Persistence criteria:** ≥2 prescriptions, ≥180 days coverage, ≤30 day gaps

## 2. Mental Health-Specific Outcomes

### 2.1 MH Service Encounters (New)
**Definition:** Healthcare visits with mental health focus identified by:
- Provider specialty (psychiatric, psychological, behavioral health)
- Primary/secondary mental health diagnosis codes
- Mental health facility encounters

**Metrics:**
- Total MH encounters per patient
- MH encounter proportion of total utilization
- High utilization flags (≥5 MH encounters)

### 2.2 Psychiatric Emergency Department Visits (New)
**Definition:** Emergency encounters meeting psychiatric criteria:
1. Emergency department encounter type AND
2. Mental health diagnosis OR psychiatric discharge disposition OR MH provider consultation

**Clinical Significance:** Represents acute psychiatric crises and healthcare system strain

## 3. Advanced Causal Methods (H4-H6)

### 3.1 H4: Mediation Analysis

![Mediation Pathway Diagram](figures/mediation_pathway_diagram.svg)

**Method:** Baron & Kenny approach with Sobel significance testing

**Research Question:** Do psychiatric referral patterns mediate the relationship between SSD exposure and mental health service utilization?

**Pathway Model:**
- Direct effect (c'): SSD → MH Utilization  
- Indirect effect (a×b): SSD → Psychiatric Referrals → MH Utilization
- Total effect (c): c' + a×b

**Key Findings:** [Results to be populated from actual analysis]
- Total effect: [TBD]
- Direct effect: [TBD]  
- Indirect effect: [TBD]
- Proportion mediated: [TBD]%
- Sobel test p-value: [TBD]

### 3.2 H5: Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

![CATE Heterogeneity Heatmap](figures/cate_heatmap.svg)

**Method:** Causal Forest for individual treatment effect estimation

**Research Question:** Which patient characteristics modify the effect of SSD exposure on mental health outcomes?

**Approach:**
- Separate random forest models for treated/control groups
- Individual treatment effects: τᵢ = μ₁(Xᵢ) - μ₀(Xᵢ)
- Variable importance ranking for effect heterogeneity

**Key Findings:** [Results to be populated from actual analysis]
- Mean CATE: [TBD]
- Effect heterogeneity range: [TBD] to [TBD]
- High responders: [TBD]% of patients
- Top effect modifiers: [TBD]

### 3.3 H6: G-computation for Intervention Simulation

**Method:** Parametric G-formula with intervention scenarios

**Research Question:** What would be the population-level impact of different SSD screening and treatment strategies?

**Intervention Scenarios:**
1. **Status quo:** Current exposure rates
2. **50% reduction:** Targeted SSD prevention
3. **Universal screening:** 90% identification rate
4. **Exposure elimination:** Minimal residual SSD (10%)

**Key Findings:** [Results to be populated from actual analysis]
- Baseline risk: [TBD]
- Universal screening impact: [TBD] risk difference (95% CI: [TBD])
- Prevention potential: [TBD] risk reduction

## 4. Bias Assessment and Sensitivity Analysis

### 4.1 E-value Analysis

![E-value Bias Sensitivity Plot](figures/evalue_plot.svg)

**Purpose:** Quantify robustness to unmeasured confounding

**E-values for Main Effects:**
- H1 (Normal labs): [TBD]
- H2 (Psychiatric referrals): [TBD]  
- H3 (Drug persistence): [TBD]

**Interpretation:** E-values >2.0 indicate moderate robustness to unmeasured confounding

### 4.2 Propensity Score Balance

![Love Plot - MH Covariates](figures/love_plot_mh.svg)

**Updated covariate set for mental health population:**
- Demographics: age, sex, socioeconomic indicators
- Mental health history: prior diagnoses, psychiatric referrals
- Medication history: antidepressant, anxiolytic use
- Healthcare utilization: baseline encounter patterns

**Balance Assessment:**
- Target: Standardized mean differences <0.1 after matching
- Quality threshold: >90% of covariates achieving good balance
