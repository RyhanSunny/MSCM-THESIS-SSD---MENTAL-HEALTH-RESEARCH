# Real Data Analysis Plan - What We Can Run Today

## ‚úÖ READY TO RUN WITH REAL DATA

Based on the production readiness check, here's what will run with your **real 352,161 patient dataset**:

### **Components Using REAL Data (No Blockers)**
1. **Cohort Building** - Your actual patient cohort
2. **Exposure Detection** - Real SSD pattern identification 
3. **Autoencoder Training** - Real patient features for severity index
4. **Outcome Measurement** - Real healthcare utilization patterns
5. **Propensity Score Estimation** - Real XGBoost with SHAP on your data
6. **Causal Effect Estimation** - TMLE, Double ML, Causal Forest with real data
7. **Missing Data Imputation** - Real missing pattern handling
8. **Temporal Analysis** - Real time-varying adjustments
9. **Mediation Analysis** - Real pathway analysis
10. **E-value Calculations** - Real sensitivity analysis
11. **Robustness Checks** - Real model validation

### **Components AUTOMATICALLY SKIPPED (Need Clinical Validation)**
1. **MC-SIMEX** - Disabled until sensitivity/specificity validated
2. **Transport Weights** - Uses synthetic ICES data (non-critical)

### **What This Means**
- **Main causal analysis**: ‚úÖ RUNS WITH REAL DATA
- **Primary research questions**: ‚úÖ ANSWERED WITH REAL DATA  
- **Publication-ready results**: ‚úÖ GENERATED (except MC-SIMEX correction)
- **Thesis defense preparation**: ‚úÖ FULLY SUPPORTED

## üöÄ EXECUTION PLAN

### **Phase 1: Run Real Analysis Now**
```bash
# This will process your 352,161 real patients
make week1-validation  # Real cohort + exposure detection
make week2-all         # Real propensity scores + causal effects
make week3-all         # Real advanced methods
make week4-all         # Real robustness + mediation
make week5-validation  # Real compliance checks
```

### **Phase 2: After Clinical Validation (1 week)**
1. Update config.yaml with validated MC-SIMEX parameters
2. Re-run with MC-SIMEX correction: `make misclassification`
3. Compare results with/without misclassification adjustment

## üìä EXPECTED REAL RESULTS TODAY

### **Primary Outcomes** (All with Real Data)
- Healthcare utilization rate ratios for SSD patients
- Emergency department visit patterns
- Specialist referral cascades  
- Medication persistence effects
- Cost implications per patient

### **Statistical Robustness** (All with Real Data)
- Propensity score balance diagnostics
- E-values for unmeasured confounding
- Multiple causal estimation methods comparison
- Heterogeneous treatment effects by subgroups

### **Clinical Insights** (All from Real Patients)
- SSD severity distribution in your cohort
- Comorbidity patterns
- Healthcare seeking behaviors
- Resource utilization patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT NEEDS REAL DATA (Currently Synthetic)

### **1. ICES Population Marginals**
- **Current**: Synthetic Ontario demographics (perfect 0.20 quintiles)
- **Impact**: Only affects external validity assessment
- **Real data needed**: Actual Ontario population characteristics
- **How to get**: Contact ICES for demographic marginals
- **Urgency**: LOW - main analysis unaffected

### **2. MC-SIMEX Parameters** 
- **Current**: Literature values (0.82/0.82)
- **Impact**: Misclassification bias correction
- **Real data needed**: Chart review of 200 patients for true sensitivity/specificity
- **How to get**: Clinical team validation using CLINICAL_VALIDATION_REQUEST.md
- **Urgency**: MEDIUM - affects bias correction only

## üìã POST-CLINICAL-VALIDATION PLAN

### **When You Receive Completed CLINICAL_VALIDATION_REQUEST.md:**

1. **Update config.yaml** with validated parameters:
   ```yaml
   mc_simex:
     enabled: true
     sensitivity: [CLINICIAN_PROVIDED_VALUE]
     specificity: [CLINICIAN_PROVIDED_VALUE]
   ```

2. **Re-run misclassification correction**:
   ```bash
   make misclassification
   ```

3. **Compare results**:
   - Main results (without MC-SIMEX)
   - Bias-corrected results (with MC-SIMEX)
   - Quantify impact of misclassification

4. **Final deliverables**:
   - Primary analysis results (robust without MC-SIMEX)
   - Sensitivity analysis with bias correction
   - Complete thesis-ready findings

## üéØ BOTTOM LINE

**You can run comprehensive real-data analysis TODAY** covering:
- Primary research hypotheses
- Causal effect estimation  
- Robustness validation
- Publication-ready results

The clinical validation enhances but doesn't block your core findings. Your thesis defense can proceed with the real-data results generated today.

**Recommended Action**: Run `make week1-validation` first to verify everything works, then proceed with full analysis while clinical validation is in progress.
