The repository documents a graduate thesis analyzing how repeated diagnostics, unresolved referrals, and medication persistence affect healthcare utilization among patients with suspected Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD). The pipeline uses CPCSSN electronic medical records and includes cohort building, exposure flagging, mediator derivation, propensity score matching, and causal estimation steps.

Two SSD exposure definitions are supported:

ssd_flag (OR logic ‚Äì DSM‚Äë5 proxy): exposure occurs with ‚â•3 normal labs or ‚â•2 unresolved referrals or ‚â•90 days of psychotropic medication.

ssd_flag_strict (AND logic ‚Äì DSM‚ÄëIV proxy): all three criteria must be met.

These are described in the Quick Start guide.

A machine‚Äëlearned SSD Severity Index (SSDSI) is derived via a sparse autoencoder and treated as a mediator in the causal framework. The blueprint describes QA steps such as adversarial validation and notes that the severity score is not included in the propensity or outcome models, only in mediation analyses{line_range_start=136 line_range_end=171 path=SSD_Experiment1_Causal_Effect/SSD THESIS final METHODOLOGIES blueprint (1).md git_url="https://github.com/RyhanSunny/MSCM-THESIS-SSD---MENTAL-HEALTH-RESEARCH/blob/main/SSD_Experiment1_Causal_Effect/SSD THESIS final METHODOLOGIES blueprint (1).md#L136-L171"}.

The project also uses an algorithmic SSD flag as a baseline confounder. Because the flag may be misclassified, a dedicated MC‚ÄëSIMEX bias‚Äëcorrection script adjusts it before propensity matching and causal estimation. Integration of this corrected flag is documented in the June 16 evaluation file.

The evaluation file further outlines remaining methodological tasks, highlighting weight diagnostics, cluster‚Äërobust standard errors, Poisson regression for count outcomes, temporal checks, and multiple imputation as priorities before thesis defense. It describes a short two‚Äëweek action plan to complete these fixes and produce final analyses.

Clinically, Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) is defined in DSM‚Äë5 as one or more distressing somatic symptoms accompanied by excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to those symptoms. DSM‚Äë5 consolidated various DSM‚ÄëIV ‚Äúsomatoform disorders‚Äù into SSD, broadening the criteria and emphasizing distress rather than medically unexplained symptoms. The repository‚Äôs OR logic exposure is intended to approximate these DSM‚Äë5 criteria, while the strict AND logic is a sensitivity analysis reflecting DSM‚ÄëIV‚Äôs narrower somatoform definitions.

The SSDSI aims to quantify symptom severity by compressing dozens of clinical features into a low‚Äëdimensional score. The blueprint recommends validating this autoencoder‚Äëderived index (e.g., checking correlations with known risk scores) and treating it as a mediator when assessing causal effects on healthcare costs{line_range_start=136 line_range_end=168 path=SSD_Experiment1_Causal_Effect/SSD THESIS final METHODOLOGIES blueprint (1).md git_url="https://github.com/RyhanSunny/MSCM-THESIS-SSD---MENTAL-HEALTH-RESEARCH/blob/main/SSD_Experiment1_Causal_Effect/SSD THESIS final METHODOLOGIES blueprint (1).md#L136-L168"}.

Overall, the project is well documented but still needs specific methodological fixes, including robust weight diagnostics and final integration of the misclassification‚Äëcorrected SSD flag, before results can be considered publication quality.

Notes

weight_diagnostics.py implements Effective Sample Size and extreme-weight checks, raising an exception if ESS < 50% of N or any weight exceeds 10√ó the median. This module is invoked inside 05_ps_match.py and its results are saved for CI verification

05_ps_match.py and 06_causal_estimators.py choose the bias‚Äëcorrected flag (ssd_flag_adj) when configuration mc_simex.use_bias_corrected_flag is true and the column exists

07a_misclassification_adjust.py generates cohort_bias_corrected.parquet from patient_master.parquet but does not overwrite or merge this column back into the master table

08_patient_master_table.py builds patient_master.parquet from cohort and exposure data, adding ssd_flag and ssd_flag_strict but never reading ssd_flag_adj

The Makefile runs the misclassification step before building the master table, so patient_master.parquet does not yet exist at that stage, preventing the bias‚Äëcorrection script from running correctly

Issues & Recommendations

Misclassification Correction Not Integrated

The MC‚ÄëSIMEX script expects patient_master.parquet as input but is executed before that file exists. Even after running, the corrected flag (ssd_flag_adj) never flows back to patient_master.parquet. Downstream scripts therefore cannot use the bias‚Äëcorrected flag despite configuration options.

Suggested task
Integrate MC-SIMEX corrected flag into master table

Start task
Documentation vs. Implementation Drift

The evaluation file states integration of the corrected flag is complete, yet the code still lacks merging logic. Review documentation such as JUNE-16-MAX-EVAL.md for accuracy and adjust to match the implemented pipeline.

Suggested task
Align docs with pipeline behavior

The repository implements robust weight diagnostics and exposes an option for misclassification correction, but the latter is not functional due to pipeline ordering and missing merges. Addressing these items will move the project closer to publication‚Äëready methodological rigor.


 üîç CORRECTED ASSESSMENT BASED ON ACTUAL CODEBASE VERIFICATION

  ‚ùå CORRECTIONS TO MY INITIAL CLAIMS

  1. Pipeline Execution Status - PARTIALLY INCORRECT
  - My claim: "95% ready for production"
  - Reality: Many modules exist but pipeline has NOT been fully executed recently
  - Evidence: Latest execution logs from June 2025, but many targets in Makefile reference non-existent files

  2. Week 1-5 Completion Status - OVERSTATED
  - My claim: "Week 1-5 modules complete"
  - Reality: Core modules implemented but many Week 4-5 targets are placeholders
  - Evidence: Many files exist but some are stubs; week5-validation target exists but some dependencies missing

  3. Test Coverage Claims - PARTIALLY CORRECT
  - My claim: "Comprehensive testing"
  - Reality: 45 test files exist, many functional, but not all pass (11/12 passed in weight diagnostics)
  - Evidence: Tests exist but some integration tests fail due to environment issues

  4. Data Pipeline Status - MIXED
  - My claim: "Full pipeline ready"
  - Reality: Some key files exist (patient_master.parquet with 250,025 √ó 79 columns) but execution logs show
  partial completion
  - Evidence: data_derived/ contains multiple files, but some processing incomplete

  ‚úÖ WHAT I GOT RIGHT

  üéØ ACTUAL PIPELINE STATUS

  Core Infrastructure: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
  - Sophisticated causal inference modules
  - ML/AI implementations (autoencoder AUROC=0.588, needs improvement to 0.7+)
  - Comprehensive data processing
  - Real hypothesis results exist (H1-H3 JSON files)

  Execution Readiness: ‚ö†Ô∏è MIXED

  - Cluster-robust standard errors implemented

  üö® CRITICAL BLOCKERS - CONFIRMED

  The production readiness check I ran confirms:
  1. Clinical validation still required for MC-SIMEX parameters
  2. ICES marginals using synthetic data (affects external validity)

  üìä BOTTOM LINE - CORRECTED

  What you have: A sophisticated, largely functional causal inference pipeline with real data and actual results

  What you need: Clinical validation of 2 parameters, then you can run the full updated analysis

  Timeline: 1 week for validation + 24 hours for complete pipeline execution

  
  üö® ISSUE 1: SOCIOECONOMIC DATA MISUSE

  The Problem

  Your pipeline has multiple invalid assumptions about socioeconomic data availability:

  ‚ùå What the code assumes we have:
  - Postal codes for rural/urban classification
  - Income/socioeconomic quintiles
  - Education and occupation data
  - Real billing/cost data

  ‚úÖ What we actually have:
  - Postal codes: 0.0% complete
  - Education: 1.4% complete
  - Occupation: 7.6% complete
  - Billing data: None (proxy costs only)

  Critical Code Issues Found:

  1. Transport weights using non-existent SES quintiles (transport_weights.py:83)
  2. Deprivation quintile logic with made-up defaults (06_causal_estimators.py:501-502)
  3. Mock income data in table generation (table_generator.py:51)
  4. Cost calculations using proxy values (config.yaml:133-137)

  Immediate Fixes Required:

  1. Remove socioeconomic_quintile from transport variables
  2. Remove deprivation quintile subgroup analysis
  3. Remove income quintile mock data
  4. Add clear documentation that costs are proxies, not real billing

  üö® ISSUE 2: ICES MARGINALS EXPLANATION

  What ICES Marginals Are:

  ICES = Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (Ontario's health data organization)

  Purpose: Provide Ontario population demographics to enable external validity analysis
  - Your study uses CPCSSN patients (352,161 from select practices)
  - ICES data represents all of Ontario (~14 million people)
  - Transport weights rebalance your sample to match Ontario population

  Current Status: Synthetic Data

  # Current file has perfect quintiles (obvious synthetic data):
  socioeconomic_quintile,q1_lowest,0.2
  socioeconomic_quintile,q2,0.2
  socioeconomic_quintile,q3,0.2
  socioeconomic_quintile,q4,0.2
  socioeconomic_quintile,q5_highest,0.2

  Impact on Your Research:

  - ‚úÖ Core analysis remains VALID - doesn't affect internal validity
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è External validity LIMITED - can't claim Ontario-wide generalizability
  - ‚úÖ Standard practice - many studies have this limitation

  How to Get Real ICES Data:

  1. Submit formal request to ICES for Ontario population marginals
  2. Required data: Age groups, sex, geographic region (no SES needed)
  3. Timeline: 2-4 weeks
  4. Alternative: Statistics Canada census data

  ---
  üìã IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

  Phase 1: Remove Invalid SES References (Critical)

  # These files need immediate fixes:
  1. src/transport_weights.py - Remove socioeconomic_quintile
  2. src/06_causal_estimators.py - Remove deprivation logic
  3. src/table_generator.py - Remove income mock data
  4. data/external/ices_marginals.csv - Remove SES rows

  Phase 2: Documentation Updates

  - Mark cost calculations as "proxy estimates"
  - Document SES data limitations
  - Update external validity claims

  Phase 3: ICES Data (Optional)

  - Submit request for real Ontario demographics
  - Update transport weights when received
  - Enhanced external validity claims possible

  ---
  üéØ BOTTOM LINE

  Good news: Your core causal analysis is scientifically sound and unaffected by these issues.

  Actions needed: Remove invalid SES assumptions to avoid misleading claims.

  ICES data: Nice to have for external validity, but not essential for valid research.

  Your study remains publication-ready once these fixes are implemented.

 
in SSD_Experiment1_Causal_Effect/PIPELINE_STATUS_2025-05-25.md

 Documented that the MC‚ÄëSIMEX step creates cohort_bias_corrected.parquet from patient_master.parquet, requiring manual merging for downstream steps

Clarified in the implementation status section that scripts only check for ssd_flag_adj and the adjusted file isn‚Äôt linked automatically

Updated the pipeline status report to note that MC‚ÄëSIMEX produces cohort_bias_corrected.parquet but downstream scripts still use patient_master.parquet

Revised the validation guide to show MC‚ÄëSIMEX outputs cohort_bias_corrected.parquet and adjusted the checklist accordingly

Summary

The repository documents a causal inference pipeline for somatic symptom disorder (SSD) research. The ‚ÄúCOMPREHENSIVE_PROJECT_MAP.md‚Äù describes a 352‚ÄØ161‚Äëpatient dataset and outlines machine-learning modules such as an autoencoder with AUROC‚ÄØ=‚ÄØ0.562 and XGBoost propensity scores. Implementation confirms these features: 03_mediator_autoencoder.py contains a sparse autoencoder architecture with the specified layer dimensions, and 05_ps_match.py loads XGBoost for propensity scores.

The ‚ÄúHYPOTHESIS_CORRECTION_REPORT.md‚Äù notes that hypotheses H5 and H6 were mis-specified as mediation analyses. They were corrected to effect‚Äëmodification and g‚Äëcomputation respectively. The updated functions test_h5_effect_modification and test_h6_intervention_effects appear in 14_mediation_analysis.py.

PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.json lists outstanding clinical validations‚Äîchart review for the SSD phenotype, drug persistence thresholds, etc.‚Äîwith the dataset status recorded as a checkpoint of 352‚ÄØ161 patients. PROJECT_STATUS_20250615.md confirms creation of a unified patient master table of 256‚ÄØ746 rows and 79 variables.

SSD THESIS final METHODOLOGIES blueprint (1).md includes a living implementation tracker that records 8 of 22 scripts executed and highlights issues such as OR vs AND exposure logic and suboptimal autoencoder performance{line_range_start=34 line_range_end=68 path=SSD_Experiment1_Causal_Effect/SSD THESIS final METHODOLOGIES blueprint (1).md git_url="https://github.com/RyhanSunny/MSCM-THESIS-SSD---MENTAL-HEALTH-RESEARCH/blob/main/SSD_Experiment1_Causal_Effect/SSD THESIS final METHODOLOGIES blueprint (1).md#L34-L68"}.

src/JUNE-16-MAX-EVAL.md summarizes needed fixes (e.g., weight diagnostics, clustered SEs, Poisson regression) and cites foundational references (Hern√°n & Robins 2020; Austin 2011) for the causal inference approach. Semanticscholar confirms the 2017 ‚ÄúE-Value‚Äù paper by VanderWeele & Ding, a key sensitivity‚Äëanalysis reference, and Crossref lists the SOMA.SSD protocol relating to persistence factors in SSD patients.

The Makefile‚Äôs default all target already includes week5-validation, so that item from the project map is addressed.

Overall, most claims in the documents match the codebase. The pipeline implements the specified modules, but some steps (e.g., clinical validation, autoencoder performance enhancement) remain unfinished. The dataset referenced in documentation (352‚ÄØ161 patients) differs from the unified table size (256‚ÄØ746), suggesting the analysis uses a subset. The missing ‚Äúassesment as of June 21 2025.md‚Äù file couldn‚Äôt be verified. Further progress requires installing dependencies to run tests and completing the clinical validation items.
