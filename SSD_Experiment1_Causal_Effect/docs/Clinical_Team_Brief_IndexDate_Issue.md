# Clinical Input Needed: Missing Laboratory Dates in SSD Study

**To**: Care4Mind Clinical Team  
**From**: Ryhan Suny, MSc  
**Date**: July 1, 2025  
**Subject**: 28% of patients missing lab dates - need clinical guidance

## The Issue

Our SSD analysis pipeline discovered that **70,762 patients (28%)** in our mental health cohort have **no laboratory test records**. This creates a technical problem: we cannot establish an "index date" (starting point) for tracking their disease progression.

## Why This Matters

1. **We need a starting point** to measure exposure windows and outcomes
2. **These patients may represent a distinct clinical pattern** - those who avoid diagnostic testing
3. **DSM-5 supports our approach**: The new criteria focus on excessive worry about symptoms, NOT whether labs are normal

## What the Literature Says

Research validates that some SSD patients avoid medical tests:
- **14%** consistently avoid all diagnostic procedures (Newby et al., 2017)
- **61%** fluctuate between avoiding tests and seeking excessive care
- This "avoidant" behavior is itself a clinical feature of SSD

## Our Proposed Solution

Use a **hierarchical approach** for setting index dates:

1. **If lab date exists** → Use first lab date (72% of patients)
2. **If no labs** → Use first mental health visit date
3. **If neither** → Use first psychotropic prescription date

This ensures every patient has a valid starting point for analysis.

## What We Need From You

### 1. **Clinical Validation** (Most Important)
Do you agree that patients without any lab tests likely represent an "avoidant SSD phenotype"?
- [ ] Yes, this is clinically meaningful
- [ ] No, there may be other explanations
- [ ] Need more information

### 2. **Index Date Hierarchy**
Is our proposed order clinically appropriate?
- [ ] Approve as proposed
- [ ] Suggest different order: _______________

### 3. **DSM-5 Criteria Interpretation**
For patients WITHOUT labs, should we identify SSD using:
- [ ] High healthcare utilization (>95th percentile visits)
- [ ] Prolonged anxiety medication use (>6 months)
- [ ] Multiple specialist referrals (>3 per year)
- [ ] All of the above
- [ ] Other: _______________

### 4. **Analysis Approach**
Should we:
- [ ] A. Analyze test-seekers and test-avoiders separately (recommended)
- [ ] B. Combine all patients using the hierarchical dates
- [ ] C. Exclude the 28% without labs (not recommended - loses important subgroup)

## Timeline

We need your input by **[Date]** to proceed with analysis.

## Key Benefit

Rather than seeing this as a limitation, we view it as an opportunity to identify and characterize the **"avoidant SSD phenotype"** - a clinically important subgroup that has not been well-studied in the literature.

**Quick Response Form** (Circle your choices):

1. Avoidant phenotype is real: **YES / NO / UNSURE**
2. Hierarchical dates OK: **YES / NO / MODIFY**
3. Use DSM-5 B-criteria: **YES / NO / DISCUSS**
4. Analysis approach: **A (Separate) / B (Combined) / C (Exclude)**
