    " The idea is to read the original file line‐by‐line and “accumulate” any rows that appear to be broken (i.e. that don’t have the expected number of delimiters). In our case we expect 24 pipe characters per “good” row (25 fields). When we see a line with too few pipes, we remove any trailing backslash (which seems to be the marker used in your file) and then append the next line until the accumulated line has the required number of delimiters. Finally, we write each fixed (joined) row to a new file (named with a _fixed.csv suffix)."
