# SSD Project Status Investigation Findings

## Investigation Date: 2025-06-21

### Verified Implementations (Weeks 1-5)
- **Week 1 modules EXIST**: weight_diagnostics.py, cluster_robust_se.py, temporal_validator.py
- **Week 4 MH modules EXIST**: mh_cohort_builder.py, mh_exposure_enhanced.py, mh_outcomes.py, advanced_analyses.py
- **Week 5 modules EXIST**: 16_reconcile_estimates.py, transport_weights.py, week4/week5 figure generators
- **Test coverage EXTENSIVE**: 40+ test files in tests/ directory
- **Results GENERATED**: hypothesis_h1/h2/h3.json files exist, figures generated (DAG, forest plot, etc.)

### Critical Findings on Production Blockers

1. **MC-SIMEX Parameters (CONFIRMED ISSUE)**
   - config.yaml contains sensitivity=0.82, specificity=0.82
   - NO comments indicating these are placeholders, but RYHAN_HUMAN_ATTENTION_TASKS.md claims they are from literature
   - SSD_Phenotype_Validation.ipynb EXISTS for validation but appears not executed with real clinical review

2. **ICES External Data (CONFIRMED ISSUE)**
   - ices_marginals.csv contains synthetic data (perfect 0.20 for all SES quintiles)
   - transport_weights.py has create_example_ices_marginals() function confirming it's test data
   - Code gracefully handles missing ICES data but current file is clearly example data

3. **Checkpoint Data Usage (CONFIRMED ISSUE)**
   - Pipeline uses checkpoint_1_20250318_024427 with 352,161 patients
   - This is sample data, not the full 250,000+ patient cohort mentioned
   - 01_cohort_builder.py uses latest_checkpoint() function pointing to sample data

4. **Library Fallbacks (PARTIAL TRUTH)**
   - DoWhy and econml ARE imported in some modules (06_causal_estimators.py, 14_mediation_analysis.py)
   - BUT with fallback mechanisms when not available
   - advanced_analyses.py uses sklearn instead of DoWhy/econml despite claims

### Implementation Quality Assessment
- Code quality appears HIGH with proper error handling and documentation
- TDD compliance evident from extensive test suite
- Modular architecture well-implemented
- CI/CD integration via Makefile with week1-5 targets

### Production Readiness Reality
- **Technical Implementation**: ~95% complete as claimed
- **Clinical Validation**: 0% complete as claimed
- **Data Integration**: Using sample data, not production data
- **External Validity**: Using synthetic ICES data
- **Parameter Validation**: MC-SIMEX parameters need clinical validation

The claims in prompts.md about Week 1-5 completion are TECHNICALLY ACCURATE but the RYHAN_HUMAN_ATTENTION_TASKS.md correctly identifies that clinical validation and real data integration are blocking production use.
