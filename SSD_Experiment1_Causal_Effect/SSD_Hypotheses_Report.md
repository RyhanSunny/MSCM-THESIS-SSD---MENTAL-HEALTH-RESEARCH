# Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) Research Hypotheses Report
**Understanding Healthcare Patterns in Patients with Unexplained Physical Symptoms**

---

## Executive Summary

This research investigates how patients with somatic symptom disorder (SSD) use healthcare services differently than other patients. SSD affects people who experience persistent physical symptoms that cause significant distress, even when medical tests show no clear physical cause. We're studying 256,746 Canadian primary care patients to understand these patterns and their impact on healthcare costs and quality of care.

**Key Question:** Do patients showing SSD-like healthcare patterns (excessive testing, repeated referrals, prolonged medication use) experience worse health outcomes and higher costs compared to similar patients without these patterns?

## 1. Background: What is SSD? {#background}

Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) is a condition where patients experience real physical symptoms (like pain, fatigue, or digestive issues) that significantly impact their daily life. What makes SSD unique is that:

- The symptoms are genuinely felt by patients - they're not "making it up"
- Medical tests often show normal results or don't explain the severity of symptoms
- Patients often worry excessively about their symptoms
- This leads to frequent doctor visits, multiple tests, and various treatments

**Why This Matters:**
- Affects 5-7% of the general population (Henningsen et al., 2018)
- Costs healthcare systems billions annually due to repeated testing and visits
- Patients often feel frustrated when told "nothing is wrong"
- Can lead to unnecessary procedures and medication side effects

## 2. Our Research Hypotheses {#hypotheses}

We're testing six main ideas about how SSD affects healthcare use:

### Main Hypothesis: The Healthcare Utilization Pattern
**"Patients with SSD-like patterns use more healthcare resources and have poorer outcomes"**

We identify SSD patterns through three behaviors:

#### Pattern 1: The "Worried Well" (Normal Lab Pattern)
- **What:** Patients who repeatedly get lab tests that come back normal
- **Why it matters:** Shows health anxiety despite reassuring results
- **How we measure:** 3+ normal lab tests within 2 years for similar symptoms

#### Pattern 2: The "Referral Loop" 
- **What:** Patients repeatedly referred to specialists for the same symptoms
- **Why it matters:** Indicates unresolved concerns despite specialist consultations
- **How we measure:** 2+ referrals for similar symptom complaints

#### Pattern 3: The "Persistent Medication User"
- **What:** Patients taking symptom-relief medications for extended periods
- **Why it matters:** Suggests ongoing symptoms without clear diagnosis
- **How we measure:** 90+ days of symptom-focused medications

### Specific Hypotheses We're Testing:

**H1: Cost Impact**
- Patients with SSD patterns spend 50% more on healthcare than similar patients without these patterns

**H2: Emergency Department Use**
- SSD patients visit emergency departments 2x more often for non-urgent issues

**H3: Medication Safety**
- SSD patients are more likely to experience polypharmacy (5+ medications) and potential drug interactions

**H4: Specialist Referrals**
- SSD patients see 3x more specialists without achieving symptom resolution

**H5: Treatment Satisfaction**
- SSD patients report lower satisfaction with care despite higher utilization

**H6: Long-term Outcomes**
- SSD patterns predict continued high healthcare use 2 years later

## 3. Current Findings {#findings}

### Who We're Studying
From our analysis of 256,746 Canadian primary care patients:

**Demographics:**
- **Age range:** 18-118 years (most between 30-65)
- **Sex:** 61% female, 39% male 
  - This female predominance matches global SSD research
- **Health status:** Mix of healthy patients and those with chronic conditions

### How Many Show SSD Patterns?

**Overall:** 143,579 patients (55.9%) show at least one SSD-like pattern

Breaking this down:
1. **"Worried Well" (Normal labs):** 112,134 patients (43.7%)
   - These patients repeatedly get blood work, X-rays, or other tests
   - Results consistently come back normal
   - Yet they continue seeking more testing

2. **"Referral Loop":** 1,536 patients (0.6%)
   - Much lower than expected
   - May indicate Canadian healthcare system differences
   - Or our criteria may be too strict

3. **"Persistent Medication":** 51,218 patients (19.9%)
   - Taking pain relievers, anti-anxiety meds, or sleep aids
   - For 3+ months continuously
   - Without clear medical diagnosis

**Overlap Between Patterns:**
- 20,215 patients show both normal lab AND medication patterns
- Only 199 patients show all three patterns
- This suggests different "types" of SSD presentations

### Healthcare Costs So Far

**Estimated medical costs (proxy calculation):**
- All patients average: $425 per year
- Range: $0 to $24,600
- No extreme outliers (no one spending >$100,000)

**How we calculated costs:**
We don't have actual billing data, so we estimated costs using Ontario healthcare rates:
- Each primary care visit: $75 (code A007)
- Each emergency visit: $600 (CIHI average)
- Each specialist referral: $180 (code A415)

Source: Ontario Schedule of Benefits for Physician Services

**Important notes:**
- These are proxy estimates, not actual billed amounts
- Drug costs not yet included
- Lab/imaging costs not yet included
- We haven't compared SSD vs non-SSD patients yet

### Healthcare Use Patterns

**Doctor visits:**
- Average: 4.7 visits per patient over study period
- Half of patients: 2 or fewer visits
- Some high users: Up to 328 visits

**Emergency visits:**
- Very low overall (near 0 average)
- Maximum: 17 visits by one patient

**Specialist referrals:**
- Average: 0.38 referrals per patient
- Most patients: No referrals
- Maximum: 31 referrals for one patient

### Quality Indicators

**Medication concerns:**
- 8% taking potentially inappropriate medications
- 58% on multiple medications (polypharmacy risk)

### Severity Assessment

We created a "severity score" (0-100) using artificial intelligence to analyze:
- How often patients visit
- Types of symptoms reported
- Number of different treatments tried
- Pattern of healthcare seeking

This helps us identify which patients have more severe SSD presentations.

## 4. What This Means {#interpretation}

### Key Insights So Far

1. **SSD patterns are common**
   - Over half of primary care patients show some SSD-like behavior
   - This doesn't mean they all have SSD - some may have undiagnosed conditions
   - But it shows these patterns significantly impact healthcare systems

2. **Different patterns for different patients**
   - Most common: Repeated normal testing (44%)
   - Also common: Long-term symptom medications (20%)
   - Less common: Specialist referral loops (0.6%)

3. **Women more affected**
   - 61% of our sample is female
   - Matches research showing women more likely to experience SSD
   - May relate to:
     - Biological differences in pain perception
     - Social factors in symptom expression
     - Healthcare seeking behaviors

4. **Costs appear moderate (so far)**
   - Average $425/year not extreme
   - But we haven't compared SSD vs non-SSD yet
   - Real impact may emerge in comparison

### Clinical Implications

**For Patients:**
- If you have ongoing symptoms with normal tests, you're not alone
- These patterns are common in primary care
- Important to work with your doctor on symptom management

**For Doctors:**
- Need strategies to help patients with persistent symptoms
- Balance thorough evaluation with avoiding excess testing
- Focus on function and quality of life, not just diagnosis

**For Healthcare Systems:**
- These patterns affect majority of primary care patients
- Need systematic approaches to manage
- Potential for significant cost savings with better care models

## 5. Next Steps {#next-steps}

### Immediate Analysis Plans

1. **Compare outcomes** between SSD and non-SSD patients
2. **Adjust for differences** in age, sex, and health conditions
3. **Calculate true cost impact** of SSD patterns
4. **Identify risk factors** for developing SSD patterns
5. **Test interventions** that might help

### What We'll Learn

By the end of this study, we'll know:
- How much extra SSD patterns cost the healthcare system
- Whether these patients have worse health outcomes
- Which patients are at highest risk
- What interventions might help break the cycle
