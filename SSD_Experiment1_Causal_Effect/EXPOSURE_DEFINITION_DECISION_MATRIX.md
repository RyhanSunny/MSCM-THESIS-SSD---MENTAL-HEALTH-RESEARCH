# SSD Causal Effect Study: EXPOSURE DEFINITION DECISION MATRIX  
**Date**: January 7, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **Final Decision ‚Äì OR logic selected on May 25, 2025**
**Prepared by**: Claude (Following CLAUDE.md Requirements)  

**Decision Rationale**: Validation analyses showed OR logic provides sufficient power while still representing clinically diverse SSD presentations. The research team confirmed this approach on May 25, 2025.

## üö® **UNCERTAINTY ACKNOWLEDGMENT**

<uncertainty>
I'm unsure about the exposure definition because:
- Felipe enhancement document explicitly mandates AND logic for clinical specificity
- Blueprint document shows AND logic was originally specified (199 patients)
- Current implementation uses OR logic for statistical power (143,579 patients) 
- This represents a 721x difference in sample size with massive validity implications

Options I'm considering:
1. **OR Logic** - Pros: Adequate power (n=143k), proven implementation, heterogeneous SSD phenotype
   Cons: May not align with Dr. Felipe's clinical vision, includes milder cases
2. **AND Logic** - Pros: Clinical specificity, aligns with blueprint/Felipe requirements, homogeneous severe cases
   Cons: Severely underpowered (n=199), limited generalizability  
3. **Dual Analysis** - Pros: Addresses both clinical and statistical concerns
   Cons: Complex interpretation, requires both approaches

Recommendation: **I need user input on clinical research priorities before proceeding**
</uncertainty>

## üî¨ **DETAILED ANALYSIS**

### **OR Logic (Any Criterion) - Current Implementation**

#### ‚úÖ **Advantages**:
1. **Statistical Power**: 143,579 exposed patients provide excellent power for causal analysis
2. **Generalizability**: Captures broader SSD phenotype including milder presentations
3. **Proven Implementation**: All downstream analyses already validated with this definition
4. **Clinical Heterogeneity**: Reflects real-world SSD spectrum with various presentations
5. **Literature Alignment**: Most SSD studies use inclusive definitions due to diagnostic complexity

#### ‚ùå **Disadvantages**:
1. **Blueprint Deviation**: Does not match original study specification
2. **Clinical Dilution**: May include patients without true SSD pathophysiology  
3. **Effect Dilution**: Heterogeneous population may attenuate causal effects
4. **Felipe Conflict**: Contradicts Dr. Felipe's emphasis on severe, specific cases

#### **Supporting Evidence**:
- Current validation reports show meaningful clinical patterns
- Healthcare utilization differences evident between exposed/unexposed
- All 32 enhanced module tests passing with OR logic

---

### **AND Logic (All Criteria) - Blueprint Specification**

#### ‚úÖ **Advantages**:
1. **Clinical Specificity**: Only includes patients meeting all SSD criteria
2. **Blueprint Compliance**: Matches original study design specification
3. **Homogeneous Population**: Clear clinical phenotype with severe presentations
4. **Felipe Alignment**: Matches Dr. Felipe's clinical insight about severe cases
5. **Mechanistic Clarity**: Clearer causal pathway from exposure to outcome

#### ‚ùå **Disadvantages**:
1. **Severe Power Limitation**: Only 199 exposed patients (severely underpowered)
2. **Generalizability Issues**: Results only apply to most severe SSD cases
3. **Implementation Impact**: Requires rebuilding entire analysis pipeline
4. **Sample Restriction**: May not reflect broader SSD population
5. **Statistical Validity**: Cannot detect typical effect sizes (MDE = 0.198)

#### **Clinical Risk Assessment**:
- AND logic may be too restrictive for real-world SSD diagnosis
- Most SSD patients don't meet all three criteria simultaneously
- Risk of missing important clinical insights from broader phenotype

## üéØ **DECISION OPTIONS**

### **Option A: Confirm OR Logic (RECOMMENDED)**
**Justification**: Evidence-based decision prioritizing statistical validity while maintaining clinical relevance

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Document clinical rationale for OR logic choice
- [ ] Update blueprint to reflect evidence-based decision
- [ ] Continue with enhanced pipeline as implemented
- [ ] Include AND logic as sensitivity analysis

**Timeline**: Immediate continuation (no delays)

---

### **Option B: Switch to AND Logic**
**Justification**: Prioritize clinical specificity and blueprint compliance over statistical power

**Implementation**:
- [ ] Update exposure definition in `src/02_exposure_flag.py` line 345
- [ ] Re-run all downstream analyses (scripts 03-18)
- [ ] Rebuild validation reports with AND logic
- [ ] Accept severe power limitations

**Timeline**: +1 week implementation delay

---

### **Option C: Dual Analysis Approach**
**Justification**: Address both clinical and statistical concerns through comprehensive analysis

**Primary Analysis**: OR logic (adequate power)
**Sensitivity Analysis**: AND logic (clinical specificity)
**Additional**: "2 of 3 criteria" compromise analysis

**Timeline**: +3 days for additional analyses

---

## üìã **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS BY OPTION**

### **If Option A (OR Logic)**:
```python
# No code changes needed - current implementation correct
# Document justification in study protocol
# Add sensitivity analysis with AND logic
```

### **If Option B (AND Logic)**:
```python
# In src/02_exposure_flag.py line 345:
exposure['exposure_flag'] = exposure['exposure_flag_strict']
# Re-run scripts 03-18 with new definition
# Update all validation reports
```

### **If Option C (Dual Analysis)**:
```python
# Keep current OR logic as primary
# Add comprehensive sensitivity analyses
# Include "2 of 3 criteria" intermediate definition
```

## üè• **CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS**

### **Clinical Validity Considerations**:
1. **SSD Diagnostic Complexity**: Real-world SSD diagnosis doesn't require all criteria
2. **Healthcare Utilization**: OR logic captures broader healthcare-seeking behavior
3. **Causal Pathways**: Multiple pathways to SSD-related utilization patterns
4. **Population Health**: OR logic more relevant for healthcare planning

### **Dr. Felipe Consultation Required**:
- [ ] Clinical interpretation of 721x sample size difference  
- [ ] Priority between statistical power vs clinical specificity
- [ ] Real-world SSD phenotype expectations
- [ ] Research question clarity (broad vs narrow population)
