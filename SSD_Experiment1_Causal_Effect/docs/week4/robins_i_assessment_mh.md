# ROBINS-I Bias Assessment: Mental Health SSD Study
Updated: 2025-06-17 10:34:01

## Study Information
- **Research Question:** Effect of SSD exposure on mental health service utilization
- **Target Trial:** Randomized trial of SSD screening vs. standard care in mental health patients
- **Study Design:** Retrospective cohort with propensity score weighting

## Bias Domains Assessment

### 1. Bias Due to Confounding
**Risk Level:** MODERATE

**Pre-intervention confounders:**
- Demographics (age, sex, socioeconomic status)
- Baseline mental health severity
- Comorbidity burden and complexity
- Healthcare utilization patterns
- Geographic region and practice characteristics

**Mental Health-Specific Considerations:**
- Psychiatric diagnosis heterogeneity (depression vs. anxiety vs. PTSD)
- Baseline functional impairment levels
- Social determinants affecting mental health access
- Stigma and help-seeking behavior patterns

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- IPTW with extensive covariate adjustment
- Practice-site stratification (20 sites)
- Mental health severity proxy measures
- Sensitivity analysis with unmeasured confounding (E-values)

### 2. Bias in Selection of Participants
**Risk Level:** LOW  

**Potential Selection Issues:**
- Differential loss to follow-up by mental health status
- Healthcare system engagement differences
- Insurance coverage variations

**Mental Health-Specific Considerations:**
- Crisis-driven care seeking patterns
- Episodic engagement with mental health services
- Involuntary vs. voluntary treatment entries

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Complete EHR data capture within health system
- Multiple year observation window
- Sensitivity analysis excluding early dropouts

### 3. Bias in Classification of Interventions
**Risk Level:** LOW-MODERATE

**Exposure Misclassification:**
- H1 (Normal labs): Well-defined laboratory criteria
- H2 (Psychiatric referrals): Potential incomplete referral capture
- H3 (Drug persistence): Prescription filling vs. medication adherence

**Mental Health-Specific Considerations:**
- Off-label psychiatric medication use
- Therapy and non-pharmacological interventions not captured
- Crisis interventions vs. planned treatment

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Enhanced drug class inclusion (N06A, N03A, N05A)
- 180-day persistence threshold for robustness
- Multiple exposure definition sensitivity analysis

### 4. Bias Due to Deviations from Intended Interventions
**Risk Level:** MODERATE

**Intervention Adherence Issues:**
- Medication discontinuation due to side effects
- Provider switching and treatment modifications
- Crisis interventions altering planned care

**Mental Health-Specific Considerations:**
- Medication compliance challenges in psychiatric conditions
- Treatment resistance and regimen changes
- Concurrent psychotherapy and medication interactions

**Assessment Strategy:**
- Per-protocol vs. intention-to-treat comparison
- Treatment switching analysis
- Dose-response relationship evaluation

### 5. Bias Due to Missing Data
**Risk Level:** LOW-MODERATE

**Missing Data Patterns:**
- Laboratory results (H1): Generally complete
- Referral data (H2): Potential systematic missingness
- Prescription data (H3): High completeness in EHR

**Mental Health-Specific Considerations:**
- Crisis care documentation quality
- Out-of-network mental health services
- Self-pay therapy sessions not captured

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Multiple imputation (m=5) with mental health predictors
- Missing data pattern analysis
- Sensitivity analysis with complete cases

### 6. Bias in Measurement of Outcomes
**Risk Level:** LOW

**Outcome Measurement Quality:**
- Mental health service encounters: Well-documented in EHR
- Psychiatric ED visits: Clear encounter types and discharge codes
- Provider specialty classification: Standardized taxonomy

**Mental Health-Specific Considerations:**
- Telehealth mental health services coding
- Crisis intervention vs. routine care classification  
- Billing code variations across psychiatric specialties

**Validation Strategies:**
- Multiple outcome definition sensitivity analysis
- Provider specialty validation
- Manual chart review subsample (if feasible)

### 7. Bias in Selection of Reported Results
**Risk Level:** LOW

**Reporting Strategy:**
- Pre-specified hypotheses (H1-H3) in study protocol
- Multiple outcome measures with adjustment for multiplicity
- Comprehensive sensitivity analysis reporting

**Transparency Measures:**
- Complete results for all pre-specified analyses
- Effect size reporting with confidence intervals
- Non-significant results included

## Overall Risk of Bias Assessment

### Summary Risk Levels:
- **Low Risk:** 3 domains (Selection, Outcome measurement, Result reporting)
- **Moderate Risk:** 3 domains (Confounding, Intervention deviations, Missing data)  
- **Low-Moderate Risk:** 1 domain (Intervention classification)

### Overall Assessment: **MODERATE RISK**

**Primary Concerns:**
1. Unmeasured confounding related to mental health severity and social determinants
2. Treatment adherence and regimen modifications common in psychiatric care
3. Mental health-specific missing data patterns

**Study Strengths:**
1. Large mental health cohort (n=256,746 target)
2. Comprehensive EHR data with multiple validation strategies
3. Advanced causal methods with extensive sensitivity analysis
4. Mental health-specific exposure and outcome definitions

## Recommendations for Interpretation

1. **Confounding:** Results should be interpreted as associational with careful attention to E-value sensitivity analysis
2. **Clinical Relevance:** Effects sizes should be evaluated against minimum clinically important differences in mental health outcomes
3. **Generalizability:** Findings apply to integrated health system mental health populations with similar characteristics
4. **Temporal Considerations:** Results reflect care patterns during study period and may not generalize to different healthcare delivery models

## Quality Enhancement Strategies Implemented

- Propensity score diagnostics with weight validation
- Cluster-robust standard errors for practice-level clustering  
- Multiple imputation with mental health-specific predictors
- Comprehensive sensitivity analysis including E-values
- Advanced causal methods (mediation, effect modification, G-computation)
