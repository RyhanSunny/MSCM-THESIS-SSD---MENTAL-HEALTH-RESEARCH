**Date**: December 19, 2024  
**Prepared by**: Claude AI Assistant  
**Purpose**: Executive summary of immediate actions required

---

## üéØ Immediate Actions Required (This Week)

### 1. **Clinical Expert Recruitment** (START TODAY)
- [ ] Contact psychiatrist with SSD/DSM-5 expertise for MC-SIMEX validation
- [ ] Schedule 200-patient chart review session (2-3 days needed)
- [ ] Prepare validation notebook and sample data export
- [ ] Budget approval for expert consultation ($2,000-3,000)

### 2. **Production Data Environment** (By Friday)
- [ ] Secure high-memory compute resources (32GB+ RAM)
- [ ] Request full CPCSSN dataset access (250,000+ patients)
- [ ] Setup conda environment per CLAUDE.md specifications
- [ ] Allocate 500GB+ storage for processing

### 3. **Validation Team Assembly** (This Week)
- [ ] Identify biostatistician for causal methods review
- [ ] Contact clinical pharmacist for drug persistence validation
- [ ] Find health services researcher for utilization thresholds
- [ ] Establish expert consultation budget ($5,900-9,100 total)

## üìÖ Week-by-Week Execution Plan

### **Week 1 (Dec 23-27, 2024)**
**Focus**: Critical Blockers
- Monday-Tuesday: MC-SIMEX clinical validation with expert
- Wednesday-Thursday: Full dataset integration and testing
- Friday: ICD code validation with psychiatrist

### **Week 2 (Dec 30, 2024 - Jan 3, 2025)**
**Focus**: Extended Validations
- Monday-Tuesday: Laboratory and threshold validations
- Wednesday-Thursday: Statistical method review
- Friday: Documentation and integration

### **Week 3 (Jan 6-10, 2025)**
**Focus**: Hypothesis Validation
- Monday-Thursday: H1-H6 clinical hypothesis validation
- Friday: Integration testing and preliminary results

### **Week 4 (Jan 13-17, 2025)**
**Focus**: Final Validation
- Monday-Tuesday: ICES data integration (if available)
- Wednesday-Thursday: Transport weight implementation
- Friday: Final validation report and production sign-off

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Path Items

### **Production Blockers** (Cannot proceed without these):
1. **MC-SIMEX Validation**: Currently using placeholder 0.82/0.82 values
2. **Full Dataset**: Only tested on checkpoint samples
3. **Clinical Sign-off**: No expert validation of assumptions

### **Risk Items** (May delay timeline):
1. **Expert Availability**: Holiday season may impact scheduling
2. **ICES Data Access**: 2-6 month lead time expected
3. **Compute Resources**: May need cloud infrastructure

---

## üìä Budget Requirements

### **Immediate Needs**:
- Expert Consultations: $5,900-9,100
- Compute Infrastructure: $700-1,200
- **Total**: $6,600-10,300

### **Funding Sources**:
- [ ] Confirm research grant coverage
- [ ] Request supplemental funding if needed
- [ ] Establish payment mechanisms for experts

---

## üèÅ Go/No-Go Decision Points

### **Week 1 Checkpoint** (Dec 27, 2024):
- **GO if**: MC-SIMEX validation complete, full dataset accessible
- **NO-GO if**: Cannot secure clinical expert or data access

### **Week 2 Checkpoint** (Jan 3, 2025):
- **GO if**: All validations show acceptable metrics
- **NO-GO if**: Sensitivity < 0.70 or major methodological issues

### **Final Decision** (Jan 17, 2025):
- **Production Ready if**: All blockers resolved, expert sign-offs obtained
- **Delay if**: Any critical validation fails or limitations too severe

---

## üìû Key Contacts Needed

### **Internal Team**:
- Principal Investigator: Approval for expert consultations
- IT/Data Team: Full dataset access and compute resources
- Finance: Budget approval and payment processing

### **External Experts**:
- Psychiatrist (SSD specialist): Primary contact needed
- Biostatistician: University department recommended
- Clinical Pharmacist: Hospital pharmacy director

---

## üìù Documentation Deliverables

### **By End of Week 4**:
1. Clinical validation report with real sensitivity/specificity
2. Expert sign-off documentation
3. Production readiness assessment
4. Updated configuration files (no placeholders)
5. Peer review manuscript methods section

---

## üö® Critical Message

**The pipeline CANNOT be used for research publication or clinical decisions until:**
1. Real clinical validation replaces all placeholder values
2. Full dataset integration is tested and validated
3. Expert sign-offs are obtained for all clinical assumptions
4. Production readiness criteria are met

**Estimated Timeline**: 4-6 weeks with dedicated resources
**Confidence Level**: High (if resources secured this week)
