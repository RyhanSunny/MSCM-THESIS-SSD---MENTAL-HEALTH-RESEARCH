# SSD Severity/Probability Metric Assessment: Current Implementation vs Dr. Felipe's Vision

**Date**: June 7, 2025  
**Analyst**: Ryhan Suny  
**Assessment Type**: Implementation Review Against Clinical Expert Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This assessment evaluates how well the current autoencoder-based SSD severity index aligns with Dr. Felipe's vision for "Develop a Severity or Probability Metric" that moves away from simple binary classification toward a comprehensive scoring system.

**Overall Alignment**: **PARTIAL** - Current implementation captures some elements but missing several critical components.

## Dr. Felipe's Vision: Requirements Analysis

### Original Suggestion (Quoted)
> "Move away from a simple 'in/out' diagnosis. Instead, create a scoring system that factors in repeated negative tests, multiple specialist visits, overlapping meds, and existing comorbidities. Incorporate variables such as mood/anxiety levels (when documented), prescription patterns, and number of unresolved referrals."

### Requirement Breakdown

| Component | Dr. Felipe's Vision | Current Implementation | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Output Type** | Continuous scoring system | ✅ Continuous score (0-100) | **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Repeated Negative Tests** | Factor in multiple normal lab results | ✅ `normal_lab_count` included | **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Multiple Specialist Visits** | Include specialist referral patterns | ✅ `specialist_referral_count` included | **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Overlapping Medications** | Factor in complex medication patterns | ⚠️ Limited - only duration-based | **PARTIAL** |
| **Existing Comorbidities** | Include comorbidity burden | ❌ Not explicitly included | **MISSING** |
| **Mood/Anxiety Levels** | Include documented mood states | ✅ `anxiety_flag`, `psych_dx_count` | **IMPLEMENTED** |
| **Prescription Patterns** | Analyze medication usage patterns | ⚠️ Basic - only coverage days | **PARTIAL** |
| **Unresolved Referrals** | Factor in referral completion status | ❌ Not implemented | **MISSING** |

## Current Implementation Analysis

### 1. Features Currently Included (24 total)

Based on the autoencoder implementation in `03_mediator_autoencoder.py` and the feature manifest:

#### ✅ **WELL IMPLEMENTED**
- **Symptom Patterns**: ICD-9 780-789 counts (`symptom_780_count` through `symptom_789_count`)
- **Repeated Normal Tests**: `normal_lab_count` directly addresses Dr. Felipe's requirement
- **Specialist Visits**: `specialist_referral_count` captures multiple specialist interactions
- **Psychological Indicators**: 
  - `anxiety_flag` (binary indicator)
  - `psych_dx_count` (count of psychological diagnoses)
  - `anxiolytic_flag` (medication usage)
- **Healthcare Utilization**: `visit_count_6m` captures recent visit patterns

#### ⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED**
- **Medication Patterns**: 
  - Currently: `drug_days_in_window` (duration only)
  - Missing: Overlapping medications, polypharmacy indicators, drug interactions
- **Pain-Related Symptoms**: `pain_dx_count` (basic count only)
- **GI Symptoms**: `gi_symptom_count` (basic count only)
- **Fatigue**: `fatigue_count` (basic count only)

#### ❌ **MISSING COMPONENTS**
- **Comorbidity Burden**: No Charlson score or comorbidity index integration
- **Unresolved Referrals**: No tracking of referral completion status
- **Medication Complexity**: No assessment of overlapping prescriptions or polypharmacy
- **Temporal Patterns**: No analysis of symptom evolution over time
- **Healthcare Provider Diversity**: No measure of multiple provider involvement

### 2. Model Performance Assessment

#### Current Performance Metrics
- **AUROC**: 0.588 (vs. target 0.83)
- **Feature Count**: 24 (vs. intended 56)
- **Severity Distribution**: Highly skewed (Mean: 0.80, Median: 0.42)
- **Discriminative Power**: Exposed patients show 10x higher mean severity (7.91 vs 0.79)

#### Performance Gap Analysis
The modest AUROC of 0.588 suggests the current feature set may be insufficient for robust severity assessment, aligning with Dr. Felipe's vision for more comprehensive inputs.

## Alignment Assessment by Component

### 🟢 **STRONG ALIGNMENT** (70% match)
1. **Continuous Scoring**: Successfully moved from binary to continuous scale
2. **Normal Lab Tests**: Directly captures repeated negative test pattern
3. **Specialist Referrals**: Includes multiple specialist visit tracking
4. **Psychological Factors**: Incorporates anxiety and mood indicators

### 🟡 **MODERATE ALIGNMENT** (40% match)
1. **Medication Patterns**: Basic duration tracking but missing complexity measures
2. **Symptom Diversity**: Covers multiple symptom categories but limited depth

### 🔴 **POOR ALIGNMENT** (10% match)
1. **Comorbidity Integration**: Missing despite being explicitly mentioned
2. **Referral Resolution**: No tracking of unresolved referrals
3. **Medication Overlaps**: No polypharmacy or drug interaction assessment

## Recommendations for Enhanced Alignment

### Priority 1: Critical Missing Components

#### A. Comorbidity Integration
```python
# Add to autoencoder features
charlson_score = merge_charlson_from_cohort()
comorbidity_count = count_unique_chronic_conditions()
multimorbidity_flag = (comorbidity_count >= 3).astype(int)
```

#### B. Unresolved Referrals Tracking
```python
# Enhance referral analysis
incomplete_referrals = count_referrals_without_completion()
specialist_diversity = count_unique_specialist_types()
referral_cycling = detect_repeat_referrals()
```

#### C. Medication Complexity
```python
# Enhanced prescription patterns
concurrent_medications = count_overlapping_prescriptions()
polypharmacy_score = calculate_drug_interaction_risk()
medication_classes = count_therapeutic_classes()
```

### Priority 2: Enhanced Feature Engineering

#### A. Temporal Symptom Patterns
```python
# Add temporal analysis
symptom_persistence = calculate_symptom_duration()
symptom_escalation = detect_increasing_severity()
care_seeking_frequency = calculate_visit_acceleration()
```

#### B. Provider Complexity
```python
# Healthcare system navigation complexity
unique_providers = count_distinct_healthcare_providers()
care_fragmentation = calculate_provider_diversity_index()
system_navigation_burden = measure_cross_specialty_referrals()
```

### Priority 3: Model Architecture Improvements

#### A. Target Architecture
- Increase feature count from 24 to 50+ aligned with Dr. Felipe's vision

## Conclusion

The current autoencoder implementation represents a solid foundation that captures several key elements of Dr. Felipe's vision, particularly the shift to continuous scoring and inclusion of repeated negative tests and specialist referrals. However, significant gaps remain in comorbidity integration, referral resolution tracking, and medication complexity assessment.

The roadmap outlined above would transform the current partial implementation into a comprehensive severity metric that fully embodies Dr. Felipe's vision for moving beyond binary classification toward a nuanced, clinically meaningful scoring system.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with the phased enhancement plan to achieve full alignment with the expert recommendation while maintaining the solid foundation already established.
