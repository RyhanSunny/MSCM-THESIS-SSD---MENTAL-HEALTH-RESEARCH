üìö MANDATORY: Read and Follow These Documents Religiously


CRITICAL: Before writing ANY code, you MUST:

Read  documents completely:

Reference them continuously throughout development
Never deviate from the specified architecture without explicit discussion
If something is unclear, ASK before implementing

üõ†Ô∏è Development Philosophy & Constraints
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is MANDATORY:
1. ALWAYS write tests FIRST
2. Run tests to confirm they FAIL
3. Write minimal code to make tests PASS
4. Refactor while keeping tests GREEN
5. Commit tests separately from implementation
Modular Architecture Requirements:

Each module must have a single, clear responsibility
Dependencies must flow in one direction (no circular dependencies)
Each component must be independently testable
Use dependency injection for flexibility
Follow the directory structure EXACTLY as specified /needed 
dont be overconfident.
dont presume or assume based on general knowledge, check implementation thoroughly before making claims.

Documentation Standards:

Every function/method needs a docstring with:

Purpose
Parameters with types
Return value with type
Possible exceptions
Example usage for complex functions


Complex logic requires inline comments
README.md for each major directory
API documentation using OpenAPI/Swagger
AVOID OVERCONFIDENCE:
Before implementing ANY feature:
<reasoning>
1. What problem does this solve?
2. Is this the simplest solution?
3. Does this align with our architecture?
4. What are the edge cases?
5. What could go wrong?
</reasoning>
AVOID SPAGHETTI CODE:

No functions longer than 50 lines
No super long files
No nested callbacks beyond 3 levels
Use async/await over promises
Extract complex conditions into named functions
Use meaningful variable names (no single letters except loop indices)
use version numbering and timestamps religiously

üîÑ Development Workflow

For each feature:
<feature_analysis>
- Review requirements from Architecture.md
- Identify affected components
- List required tests
- Consider edge cases
- Check security implications
</feature_analysis>

Implementation steps:

Write failing tests
Implement minimal code
Refactor for clarity
Update documentation
Run all tests
Commit with clear message


Code Review Checklist:

 Tests pass
 No linting errors
 Documentation updated
 Security considered
 Performance acceptable
 Error handling complete



üö® Security & Safety Rules
NEVER:

Store passwords in plain text
Log sensitive information
Trust user input without validation
Use string concatenation for SQL
Expose internal error messages
Store payment information

ALWAYS:

Validate and sanitize all inputs
Use parameterized queries
Implement rate limiting
Use HTTPS everywhere
Follow OWASP guidelines
Audit dependencies regularly

üí≠ Extended Thinking Mode
For complex problems, use extended thinking:
think harder about:
- Edge cases we might have missed
- Security vulnerabilities in this approach
- Performance implications at scale
- How this integrates with existing code
- Potential race conditions
ü§î When You're Unsure
DO NOT GUESS. Instead:
<uncertainty>
I'm unsure about [specific aspect] because:
- [reason 1]
- [reason 2]

Options I'm considering:
1. [option 1] - Pros: ... Cons: ...
2. [option 2] - Pros: ... Cons: ...

Recommendation: [option] because [reasoning]
</uncertainty>
‚ö° Performance Considerations

Use database indexes as specified
Implement caching strategy from Architecture.md
Batch operations where possible
Use pagination for large datasets
Profile before optimizing

üîç Debugging Approach
When something doesn't work:

Check the error message carefully
Verify assumptions with console.log/print
Test the smallest possible unit
Check Architecture.md for correct implementation
Consider edge cases
Ask for clarification if needed

Remember: You're building a production-ready system. Every decision should be justified, every line of code should have a purpose, and every feature should be thoroughly tested.
