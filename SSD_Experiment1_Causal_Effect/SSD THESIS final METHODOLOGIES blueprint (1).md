# **SSD Study: Research Question, Hypotheses, and Pipeline‚ÄìHypothesis Mapping**

## Research Question (RQ) - Mental Health Population
**In a cohort of mental health patients (n=256,746), does exposure to somatic symptom disorder (SSD) patterns‚Äîcharacterized by repeated normal diagnostic results, unresolved specialist referrals, and persistent psychotropic medication use‚Äîcausally increase mental health service utilization and emergency department visits, and can a composite SSD severity index mediate this relationship within this homogeneous mental health population?**

## Detailed Hypothesis Suite

| ID | Statement | Key Variables | Expected Direction / Effect Size | Planned Test |
|----|-----------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------|
| **H1 ‚Äî MH Diagnostic Cascade** | In MH patients, ‚â•3 normal lab panels within 12-month exposure window causally increase subsequent healthcare encounters (primary care + mental health visits) over 24 months. | Exposure: binary flag for normal-lab cascade (n=112,134, 43.7%); Outcome: count of all healthcare encounters (Poisson) | IRR ‚âà 1.35‚Äì1.50 | Poisson/negative-binomial regression after 1:1 PS-matching; over-dispersion check (Œ±). |
| **H2 ‚Äî MH Specialist Referral Loop** | In MH patients, ‚â•2 unresolved specialist referrals (NYD status) predict mental health crisis services or psychiatric emergency visits within 6 months. | Exposure: referral loop flag (n=1,536, 0.6%); Outcome: MH crisis/psychiatric ED visits (binary) | OR ‚âà 1.60‚Äì1.90 | PS-matched logistic regression; falsification with resolved referrals as negative control. |
| **H3 ‚Äî MH Medication Persistence** | In MH patients, >90 consecutive days of psychotropic medications (anxiolytic/antidepressant/hypnotic) predict emergency department visits in next year. | Exposure: psychotropic persistence (n=51,218, 19.9%); Outcome: any ED visit (binary) | aOR ‚âà 1.40‚Äì1.70 | Multivariable logistic model with IPW; E-value for unmeasured confounding. |
| **H4 ‚Äî MH SSD Severity Mediation** | In MH patients, the SSDSI (range 0-100, mean=0.80) mediates ‚â•55% of total causal effect of H1-H3 exposures on healthcare utilization costs at 24 months. | Mediator: continuous SSDSI in MH population; Outcome: total healthcare costs (gamma GLM) | Proportion mediated ‚â•0.55 | Causal mediation (DoWhy) with 5K bootstraps; sensitivity to sequential ignorability. |
| **H5 ‚Äî MH Clinical Intervention** | In high-SSDSI MH patients, integrated care with somatization-focused interventions reduces predicted utilization by ‚â•25% vs. usual mental health care. | Intervention: integrated MH-PC care; Outcome: predicted utilization reduction | Œî ‚â• -25% (95% CI excludes 0) | G-computation using validated SSDSI + published effect sizes for integrated MH care. |

**Conceptual Flow for Mental Health Population:**
1. Pre-existing mental health vulnerability ‚Üí enhanced somatic awareness and health anxiety
2. Repetitive normal diagnostics ‚Üí diagnostic uncertainty ‚Üí amplified anxiety in MH patients
3. Unresolved referrals & persistent psychotropic medications reinforce somatic preoccupation
4. MH-calibrated SSDSI aggregates these patterns with higher baseline severity
5. Mental health symptoms amplify SSD patterns, driving escalating MH service utilization
6. Crisis presentations emerge from unresolved somatic-psychiatric symptom interactions

**Alignment with RQ:**

## **Data Sources and Cohort Construction**

We will use Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) electronic medical-record extract to assemble the study cohort. The inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, and timeframe are defined a priori. The study period intentionally spans pre-pandemic and pandemic eras to assess temporal confounding due to COVID-19-related changes. If needed, an interrupted time-series approach with segmented regression will be applied to account for structural changes around the onset of COVID-19. Specifically, we will include an indicator (or separate segment) for the COVID-19 period in analyses to adjust for the abrupt system-wide changes in care delivery and outcomes. This quasi-experimental segmentation helps isolate the effect of the exposure from pandemic-related confounding.

**Cohort assembly and preprocessing**: Data will be cleaned and merged from relevant tables. We will address missing data using appropriate methods (multiple imputation or complete-case analysis) depending on extent and patterns of missingness. Outliers and data quality issues will be checked; for example, extreme values of continuous covariates will be winsorized or modeled with flexible functions if necessary. We will also perform **adversarial validation** to detect any distribution shifts between training vs. validation splits of the data, ensuring that our model development and evaluation subsets are drawn from a similar distribution. Adversarial validation involves labeling data as "train" or "test" and training a classifier to distinguish them; a high classifier accuracy or AUC \>\> 0.5 would indicate covariate distribution differences that need reconciliation (e.g. through re-sampling or covariate adjustment). This procedure guards against hidden biases due to temporal or site-based differences in the data.

## **Variables and Measurements**

### **Exposure (Treatment)**

The exposure of interest, Negative Lab Cascade (‚â•3 consecutive normal laboratory results in 12 months), is defined as a binary variable (treated vs. untreated). We will carefully document how and when exposure is measured. If time of exposure initiation varies, we will align everyone at a common index time (e.g., hospital admission or diagnosis) and treat exposure as occurring at baseline for causal inference purposes. Any time-varying nature of exposure will be addressed with appropriate longitudinal methods (described later). We assume no substantial measurement error in the exposure; if there is suspicion of misclassification (e.g. treatment identification via codes), we will conduct sensitivity analysis for exposure misclassification as part of the quality assurance.

### **Outcome**

The primary outcome, Total number of primary-care encounters in the subsequent 12 months, is assessed over a follow-up period of 12 months. This outcome is subject to potential competing risks. For instance, if the outcome is a specific cause (e.g. disease progression) and death is a competing event, we will account for this using a Fine‚ÄìGray subdistribution hazard model. The Fine‚ÄìGray model directly models the cumulative incidence function (CIF) by using a subdistribution hazard, allowing us to estimate covariate effects on the incidence of the target event in the presence of competing events. By contrast, a standard Cox model treating competing events as censored could bias effect estimates. Thus, for time-to-event analyses, we will fit both cause-specific Cox models and Fine‚ÄìGray models to ensure robustness. If the outcome is non-time-to-event (e.g. binary at a fixed time), competing risk is less of an issue, but we may define a composite endpoint combining the outcome with its major competing event to capture overall risk. All outcome definitions will be finalized prior to analysis, and we will verify outcome coding accuracy (e.g., through manual review or cross-check with external databases) as part of the QA process.

### **Confounders and Covariates**

We will adjust for a rich set of baseline confounders that are hypothesized to jointly affect exposure and outcome (based on prior literature and clinical expertise). These include age, sex, calendar year, site FE, Charlson, prior-year visit count, depression/anxiety, PTSD, Long-COVID, NYD flag, neighbourhood deprivation quintile. We use a causal DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) to guide confounder selection, ensuring we block all backdoor paths between exposure and outcome. Importantly, we will not adjust for variables that may lie on the causal pathway (mediators) or colliders that could induce bias. If certain covariates are strongly prognostic of the outcome but unaffected by exposure (e.g. age, chronic disease burden), they are still included to improve precision. All confounders are measured at baseline (before exposure) to satisfy temporal ordering for causal interpretation.

**Derived severity score (Autoencoder feature)**: A novel covariate in our analysis is an autoencoder-derived severity score, constructed from high-dimensional patient data (e.g., labs, imaging, or clinical notes). This unsupervised learning model compresses complex patient information into a single continuous severity index. We ensure the autoencoder is trained in a manner to avoid overfitting and maintain generalizability:

* We employ **regularization techniques** (e.g., weight decay, dropout and early stopping) to prevent the autoencoder from memorizing idiosyncrasies of the training data.

* We utilize **distributed training** and batch normalization so that the model can handle the large dataset efficiently within our hardware constraints (6GB GPU VRAM) and still converge to a stable representation. If the full dataset cannot fit in GPU memory, training will be done in mini-batches or using CPU with optimized libraries.

* Through **adversarial validation**, we confirm that the severity score model does not unintentionally encode site- or time-specific artifacts (for example, if trained on pre-COVID data, it should still be valid in COVID-era data). Any evidence of drift would prompt re-training or recalibration of the autoencoder.

* We validate the autoencoder severity score by checking its correlation with known risk scores and outcomes. A high severity score should correlate with worse outcomes, but we will check for any counterintuitive patterns as a QA step.

Once derived, the severity score is included as a confounder in the propensity model and outcome model (if it is deemed a baseline risk factor). This helps adjust for otherwise hard-to-capture differences in patient health status. Because this score is machine-learned, we also implement overfitting controls as described to ensure it performs reliably on new data. The Severity Index is *not* included in the propensity-score or outcome models; it is treated solely as a mediator examined in the dedicated mediation analysis (Step 14).

**SSD-Pattern Flag (Binary)**: Additionally, the analysis considers an SSD-pattern flag, a binary indicator generated (presumably by the autoencoder or another algorithm) to mark presence of a specific risk pattern (SSD). This flag is treated as a baseline confounder (included in PS and outcome models) and as a potential effect modifier in the causal-forest step. We suspect that the SSD-pattern variable may suffer from measurement error or misclassification, since it's algorithmically derived:

* To address this, we will perform **measurement error modeling** for the SSD-flag. If we have data on its accuracy (sensitivity/specificity against a gold standard), we will correct bias using methods like **misclassification SIMEX (MC-SIMEX)**. The SIMEX (simulation-extrapolation) approach involves adding incremental noise to mimic measurement error and extrapolating back to zero error, which can correct attenuation bias. We will apply the extension of SIMEX for discrete variables (MC-SIMEX) to adjust regression estimates for the SSD-flag's misclassification.

* If no gold standard is available, we will conduct a **sensitivity analysis** by varying the assumed misclassification rates of the SSD-flag (e.g., consider scenarios of 10%, 20% misclassification) to observe how the estimated treatment effect changes. This will be summarized in a sensitivity table.

* As part of QA, we will consider the SSD-flag's reliability. For example, if it is derived from clinician notes using NLP, we might do a manual chart review on a sample to estimate error rates, informing the simulation parameters for bias correction.

All covariates (including the severity score and SSD-flag) will be standardized or categorized as needed for modeling. Continuous covariates may be modeled with splines or categorized to relax linearity assumptions. We will verify there is sufficient variation in each covariate within each exposure group (to satisfy positivity), and if any variable has near-zero variance or causes numerical instability, it may be dropped or merged into others.

### **Mediator (if applicable)**

If our analysis aims to decompose the total effect into direct and indirect paths, we will identify a mediator variable that lies on the causal pathway between exposure and outcome. For example, SSD Severity Index could be an intermediate clinical outcome or biomarker influenced by the exposure and subsequently affecting the primary outcome. We will only perform formal mediation analysis if the scientific question calls for it and if the data support necessary assumptions. The critical assumption for mediation is sequential ignorability ‚Äì that there are no unmeasured confounders of the mediator‚Äìoutcome relationship after adjusting for baseline covariates and exposure. We will scrutinize this assumption by thinking through potential confounders of the mediator and outcome. If such confounders exist and are measured, we include them in the models for both mediator and outcome. If we suspect important unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding, we will not over-interpret mediation results; instead, we will report that any mediation estimates rely on the untestable assumption of no hidden confounding between mediator and outcome.

To strengthen inference about mediation, we will explore **alternative approaches**:

* If a plausible **instrumental variable (IV)** is available for the mediator (i.e. a variable that influences the mediator but has no direct effect on the outcome except through the mediator), we may use an IV approach to estimate mediated effects. For instance, using two-stage regression (treating the mediator as an endogenous variable) could help control for mediator-outcome confounding, though valid instruments are rare in practice.

* We will conduct **sensitivity analysis for mediation** (e.g., using methods by Imai or VanderWeele) to quantify how sensitive the mediation results are to hypothetical unmeasured confounders. This might involve calculating how large a confounder's effect would have to be to explain away the observed mediated effect.

If mediation analysis is performed, we will estimate the **natural indirect effect** and **natural direct effect** using standard methods (such as regression-based mediation with bootstrap for confidence intervals, or mediation within a counterfactual framework). However, given the complexity, these results will be considered exploratory unless assumptions are clearly met. We will explicitly state the additional assumption of **no exposure‚Äìmediator interaction** on the outcome if we use simple mediation formulas, or otherwise include interaction terms in the mediation models.

## **Causal Inference Analysis Plan**

### **Identification Strategy and Assumptions**

Our goal is to estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of exposure on outcome (and potentially conditional effects on subgroups). Identification of the causal effect is based on the assumptions outlined (exchangeability, positivity, consistency, no interference). By adjusting for the aforementioned confounders, we assume **conditional exchangeability**: given the covariates, the exposure is as good as random with respect to the outcome (no unmeasured confounding). We will justify this by referencing subject-matter knowledge and any available DAG. For transparency, a causal diagram will be included to illustrate assumed relationships, including any selection variables that might affect external validity (discussed later with selection diagrams for transportability).

We will use **triangulation of methods** to strengthen causal inference. That is, we plan multiple analytical approaches with different underlying assumptions or statistical properties, to see if they converge on a consistent estimate. Triangulating evidence from several methods can provide a stronger basis for causal conclusions, since each method may have different susceptibility to biases. This pre-specified multi-method approach will also guide how we resolve any discrepancies (detailed in the *Results Reconciliation* section below).

### **Propensity Score Modeling and Diagnostics**

To adjust for confounders, we will employ propensity score (PS) methods as a core component. The propensity score is the probability of receiving the exposure given all observed covariates. We will estimate the PS using a logistic regression (or machine learning model, if needed for better fit) with exposure as outcome and all confounders as predictors. Careful attention will be given to model specification: we may include polynomial terms or splines for continuous covariates and check for interactions that improve balance.

We will primarily use **inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)** to create a weighted pseudo-population. Stabilized IPTW weights will be calculated to reduce variance. If extreme weights arise (due to very small PS for some treated or vice versa), we will consider weight truncation at a small percentile (e.g., 99th percentile) to avoid undue influence of a few observations. As a sensitivity check, we might also implement **overlap weighting**, which focuses on the overlapping region of PS and tends to down-weight extreme propensity cases, improving balance.

After estimating PS, **diagnostics** are critical:

* **Overlap plots**: We will plot propensity score distributions (histograms or density plots) for treated and control groups to verify sufficient overlap. Adequate overlap is necessary for meaningful comparisons; if we find regions of non-overlap, those indicate extrapolations that undermine causal inference. In case of poor overlap, we may restrict the analysis to the common support or use matching to discard non-overlapping units. A rule of thumb is that the PS ranges should substantially overlap; if not, results will be reported as applicable only to the overlapping subset.

* **Covariate balance**: We will assess balance on all confounders after weighting (and/or matching). This includes comparing **standardized mean differences (SMD)** between exposure groups for each covariate, aiming for SMD \< 0.1 (or stricter \<0.05) for all. We will also check balance on higher-order moments and distributions of covariates, not just means. For example, we will compare variances or use quantile plots for continuous covariates across groups post-weighting to ensure the **distributional balance** is achieved, aligning with the idea of covariate-balancing propensity scores that consider higher-order moments. If any covariate remains imbalanced, we will refine the PS model (e.g., include interaction terms or use a more flexible ML model for PS) and iterate until balance is satisfactory.

* **Effect modification and heterogeneity diagnostics**: As part of propensity score diagnostics, we will explore whether the estimated treatment effect might differ across strata of the propensity score or key covariates. Significant heterogeneity could indicate that a single PS-weighted estimate might not capture all nuances. We plan to stratify the weighted sample into PS quintiles (or other strata) and estimate the treatment effect within each to see if there is a trend. Additionally, we will examine interaction terms in outcome models to detect **effect modifiers**. If, for example, the effect is much larger in low-risk patients than high-risk patients, that could be a clue about where unmeasured confounding or non-positivity might be influencing results. We will report any such heterogeneity rather than presume a constant ATE across all individuals.

Lastly, we will document the propensity model building process and include a table of baseline characteristics before and after weighting to demonstrate improved balance. This serves as evidence that the propensity score achieved its goal of making the treated and control groups comparable on observed covariates.

### **Outcome Modeling and Causal Estimation**

In addition to propensity-based weighting, we will construct outcome models to estimate the exposure effect. Depending on outcome type:

* For binary or continuous outcomes, this may be a regression model (logistic or linear) including the exposure and all confounders (a standard multivariable adjusted model).

* For time-to-event outcomes, a Cox proportional hazards model (and the Fine‚ÄìGray model as noted) will be used with exposure and confounders included.

These outcome models themselves yield an adjusted effect estimate (e.g., an adjusted hazard ratio or odds ratio). However, model misspecification is a risk, especially if relationships are nonlinear or there are high-dimensional data. Therefore, alongside the classical regression, we will deploy **flexible machine learning algorithms** to model the outcome as part of a doubly-robust strategy (described below).

We will also check the outcome model's assumptions (e.g., proportional hazards for Cox model via Schoenfeld residual tests; linearity of covariates in logistic model via partial residual plots). If assumptions are violated, we will adjust the model (for example, using stratified Cox if PH assumption fails for a covariate, or transformation of predictors if linearity fails).

### **Doubly-Robust and Machine Learning Estimators**

To leverage both the propensity score and outcome modeling approaches, we will use **doubly-robust estimators** such as Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) and Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW). These methods provide consistent estimates of the causal effect if either the treatment model (propensity score) or the outcome model is correctly specified (hence "doubly robust"). TMLE, in particular, allows the use of machine learning for estimating nuisance functions (PS and outcome regression) while still yielding an asymptotically unbiased estimate of the ATE. We will implement TMLE with the following approach:

* Use a **Super Learner** ensemble to model the outcome (including algorithms like GLM, Random Forest, and XGBoost as candidates) and similarly model the propensity score, each with cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

* Estimate initial outcome predictions and propensity, then update the outcome predictions with a clever covariate (the technique unique to TMLE) to target the estimate of risk difference or risk ratio for the exposure.

* Compute the TMLE estimate of ATE and its influence-curve-based standard error.

We choose TMLE because of its efficiency and robustness properties; it has the advantage of incorporating machine learning yet still providing valid confidence intervals under certain regularity conditions.

Additionally, we will apply **Double Machine Learning (DML)** as proposed by Chernozhukov et al. This involves splitting the sample, estimating outcome and exposure models on one part, predicting in the other, and then combining results to estimate the effect with orthogonalized moments. The DML (also known as orthogonal learners) helps reduce bias from overfitting by cross-fitting. We will implement DML with algorithms appropriate to our data size (e.g., using linear models or light gradient boosting for nuisance functions to stay within computational limits).

For exploring **heterogeneous treatment effects**, we will utilize **Causal Forests** (from the generalized random forest framework). Causal forests are a non-parametric method that directly models treatment effect heterogeneity and can provide an estimate of the ATE as the average of individual-level treatment effect predictions. We will train a causal forest with sufficient trees to stabilize individual treatment effect estimates, using honesty (splitting separate subsets for treatment effect estimation vs. tree structure) to avoid bias. The forest's variable importance for treatment heterogeneity will highlight which covariates drive effect variation.

We will also compare alternative meta-learners [POSSIBLE FUTURE WORK], such as:

* **Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)**: Using BART for causal inference (e.g., via the BART causal method or by modeling the outcome with treatment as a predictor and extracting the treatment effect). BART naturally captures nonlinearities and interactions and can yield posterior intervals for the effect. We will use BART with enough burn-in and iterations to ensure convergence (within what our computational budget allows).

* **T-learner/X-learner**: Train separate models for outcome under treated and control, or use the X-learner approach for observational data, and then derive the effect. These can be implemented with any regression method (like gradient boosting or neural nets) for flexibility.

* **Meta-learners vs TMLE**: We will benchmark these approaches in terms of bias and variance. For instance, we might run a small simulation (or resampling) study using our data structure to see which method most reliably recovers a known effect, as a form of estimator **benchmarking**.

Each estimator has trade-offs: TMLE/AIPW are doubly robust and asymptotically efficient if using parametric models; causal forests/BART can capture complex relationships but might be less precise if sample size is limited. Given our computational constraints (32GB RAM, moderate GPU), we will avoid extremely heavy learners or overly complex hyperparameter searches. Simpler learners (regularized regression, shallow trees) may sometimes be preferable to ensure convergence. All analyses will be done in R or Python using well-tested libraries (e.g., `tlverse` for TMLE, `grf` for causal forest, `sklearn` or `EconML` for DML).

**Justification of estimators**: By using a suite of methods, we satisfy a form of method triangulation. If all methods (which rely on different assumptions) point to a similar ATE, confidence in causal interpretation increases. If they diverge, this indicates sensitivity to modeling choices or violations of assumptions, which we will investigate. Methods like TMLE and DML incorporate modern best practices for causal inference with machine learning, reducing bias due to model mis-specification while controlling overfitting via cross-validation. Causal forest and BART allow us to detect and quantify effect modification rather than assume a constant effect. We will clearly document the results of each approach.

### **Adjusting for Time-Varying Confounding and Temporal Effects**

Because our data spans a period that includes systemic changes (especially the COVID-19 pandemic) and potentially time-varying confounders, we will address temporal aspects explicitly:

* If the exposure is administered at different time points or repeatedly (time-varying exposure) and there are time-varying confounders affected by past exposure, we will use **Marginal Structural Models (MSMs)**. Specifically, we would extend IPTW to the longitudinal setting: calculate stabilized weights at each time period for each individual (the inverse probability of receiving their observed treatment history given past covariates), then fit a weighted pooled regression model for the outcome. This approach (developed by Robins) appropriately adjusts for **time-dependent confounding** that standard regression would handle incorrectly due to feedback between exposure and confounders. We will monitor the weight distribution (if extreme, we may use weight truncation for stability).

* If using MSM, we will also consider **Longitudinal TMLE (LTMLE)** as an alternative, which can improve efficiency in the longitudinal context. LTMLE will use iterative targeting steps at each time point to compute an estimate of the intervention effect (like the effect had everyone been treated vs. untreated over time).

* For handling the **COVID-19 period**, as noted, we include a segment or an interaction: for example, include a term exposure*COVID-period to see if the effect changed during the pandemic. Additionally, we may perform a stratified analysis pre- and during-COVID to see if results are consistent, acknowledging that healthcare changes could violate the assumption that the same model applies across the entire timeframe.

* We will use **segmented regression** to formally assess any level or trend changes in outcome around the COVID onset. This involves including a binary indicator for post-COVID period and possibly a continuous term for time (and an interaction for post-COVID time slope). Any significant change in outcome unrelated to exposure will thus be accounted for.

* Calendar time will also be adjusted for (e.g., using year or month as covariates or categorical time blocks) if there are secular trends in exposure or outcome.

Through these methods, we aim to mitigate **temporal confounding** ‚Äì for instance, if the patient management or outcome risk changed over time independent of exposure. By weighting or modeling time appropriately, we isolate the exposure effect more cleanly.

### **Results Reconciliation and Discordant Estimates Resolution**

Given the use of multiple analytical approaches (PS-weighted outcome models, TMLE, DML, causal forest, etc.), we have a plan to handle situations where they do not agree (discordant ATE estimates):

* **Primary analysis designation**: We will designate one method as primary (e.g., TMLE with Super Learner or IPTW with outcome regression) before looking at the data. This primary result will be the focus for conclusions, while others are supportive analyses. The primary method will be chosen based on theoretical robustness and performance in any pilot analysis (for example, TMLE might be primary for its double robustness).

* **Consistency check**: We will tabulate the ATE estimates and confidence intervals from all methods side by side. If all are within each other's confidence intervals, we consider the results consistent. Minor variations are expected due to different fitting, but large discrepancies will prompt investigation.

* **Investigation of discrepancies**: If one method yields an outlying result (e.g., one says the effect is null while others show a benefit), we will examine:

  * Overlap and weight issues in the IPTW (maybe that method is sensitive to few extreme cases).

  * Model diagnostics for the discrepant method (e.g., did the outcome model converge? Were there indication of extrapolation?).

  * Check if the discrepancy correlates with a certain subgroup or region of data (for example, perhaps the causal forest finds strong effect in a subgroup that a simple model misses, explaining a different overall average).

* **Pre-specified decision rule**: We establish a rule that if methods disagree, we will report the range of estimates and explore reasons, rather than cherry-picking the most favorable. For example, if the primary analysis and at least one other credible method show significance, but another shows non-significance, we will still report that inconsistency and may lean on the method that best meets assumptions. We might conduct simulation studies mimicking our dataset to see which method is more reliable under plausible conditions (this is part of estimator benchmarking).

* In case of **discordant effect direction** (one method suggests harm vs another benefit), we will strongly suspect a violation of assumptions. We will scrutinize potential unmeasured confounding, model misspecification, or bias for each method. Our *Causal Quality Assurance* framework (below) will guide checks for each assumption that might have failed.

This proactive reconciliation framework ensures we do not ignore method differences. Instead, we use them to *triangulate* the truth. As recommended in causal inference literature, integrating results from diverse approaches can strengthen conclusions, and discrepancies can illuminate hidden biases. All decisions in this regard will be documented in the analysis report to maintain transparency.

## **Sensitivity Analyses**

We will conduct extensive sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings to various violations of assumptions:

* **Unmeasured Confounding Sensitivity**: Given that no observational study can measure all confounders, we will quantify how strong an unmeasured confounder would need to be to explain away the observed treatment effect. We will calculate the **E-value** for the risk ratio or odds ratio estimate, which gives the minimum strength of association (on risk ratio scale) that an unmeasured confounder would need with both treatment and outcome to nullify the result. In addition, we will compute **Observed Covariate E-values**, which contextualize this by showing the E-values for each observed covariate's association with the outcome. For example, if age is a strong confounder and has an E-value of X, and any hypothetical confounder would need an E-value twice that to overturn results, it provides context on plausibility. We will present a figure or table (sensitivity matrix) plotting the E-value of an unmeasured confounder against the attenuation of the effect estimate, alongside points for each observed covariate. This **"observed bias plot"** allows easy comparison of how much each known confounder moved the estimate versus what an unknown one would need to do. If the required E-value to explain away the effect is very large (e.g., \>3 on risk ratio scale) relative to known confounders, we gain confidence in a causal interpretation. Conversely, if a small E-value would suffice, caution is warranted.

* **Sensitivity to Covariate Adjustments**: We will systematically re-run the primary analysis excluding or including certain covariates to see impact. For instance, we might drop all socioeconomic variables or all lab variables and see if the effect estimate changes markedly. A **covariate omission sensitivity matrix** will be compiled to show the effect estimate when leaving out each confounder (one at a time or in logical groups). Large changes might indicate that particular variables are strongly confounding or possibly that their measurement error is influential.

* **Sequential Ignorability Check (Mediator-outcome confounding)**: If we performed mediation analysis, we will do a formal sensitivity analysis for violations of sequential ignorability. One approach is using the **mediation sensitivity parameter** (such as $\rho$ for the correlation between mediator and outcome residuals due to unmeasured confounder). We will vary this parameter to see how the estimated indirect effect changes. We will also consider a **negative control outcome or exposure** if available: an outcome that the mediator should not affect, or an exposure variant that does not affect the mediator, to test for spurious associations ‚Äì although such controls may not always be available.

* **Measurement Error Sensitivity**: Although we incorporate SIMEX for the SSD-flag in the main analysis, we will double-check by performing a simple two-stage sensitivity: (1) simulate corrected data under various assumed error rates for the SSD-flag and (2) recompute the treatment effect. This will yield a range of estimates under different misclassification scenarios. Similarly, if other key variables (exposure, outcome) have classification uncertainty, we will explore how misclassification could bias results, possibly using analytical bias formulas or simulation.

* **Alternative Outcome Definitions**: We might try a more stringent or broader outcome definition to see if results hold. For example, use 30-day outcome vs 90-day outcome, or include related events as part of a composite. This checks robustness to outcome misclassification or competing risk handling. If using the Fine-Gray model as primary, we might also report cause-specific hazard ratios for comparison.

* **Subgroup and Heterogeneity Analyses**: We will estimate effects in key subgroups (e.g., by age group, sex, risk level) to see if any subgroup drives the overall result. Consistency of direction across subgroups adds confidence that the effect is general. If a subgroup shows a different effect, we interpret cautiously and consider if that could be due to uncontrolled confounding in that subgroup or a true effect modification.

* **Model Specification Sensitivity**: We will try variations of our models: e.g., using a probit instead of logit for PS, using different link functions for outcome (log-binomial vs logit for risk ratio), or including/excluding higher-order terms. Ideally, a correctly specified model shouldn't drastically change with minor specification tweaks. Large changes might signal model dependence.

All sensitivity analysis results will be summarized in the thesis. The aim is to demonstrate that our conclusions are not an artifact of one model or one assumption. If any sensitivity analysis contradicts the main result (for example, indicating that a slight change could eliminate the effect), we will temper our conclusions accordingly and discuss this in the limitations.

## **External Validity and Transportability**

While the primary analysis focuses on internal validity (causal effect in our study sample), we also plan to assess the external validity of findings. **Transportability** refers to whether the causal effect can be generalized or transported to a different target population. We will take the following steps:

* **Characterize Study Population vs Target**: We will compare key characteristics of our cohort to those of an external population (e.g., another hospital system or national data) to identify differences. This will involve constructing a table of baseline features and noting where our sample is selective (for example, older, more comorbid, etc.).

* **Selection Diagram**: Using causal diagrams, we will draw a **selection diagram** that illustrates differences between the study population and the target population. This diagram (per Pearl and Bareinboim's framework) introduces nodes (S variables) that indicate where selection/filtering occurs. For instance, if our study is hospital patients, an S node might indicate hospitalization (only patients who got hospitalized are in our sample). We will hypothesize which factors affect both selection into our study and the outcome/treatment effects. This helps identify what data might be needed to adjust for those differences.

* **Transport Methodology**: If we have access to some data or summary statistics from the target population, we will attempt a **transport TMLE** or weighting approach. For example, we can re-weight our sample to the target population distribution of covariates (using inverse odds of selection weights) and then estimate the effect in the weighted sample. This requires that we have measured all effect modifiers that differ between populations. We will implement a transport-augmented estimator as described in literature (such as using an approach where we include an indicator for being in the source vs target and estimate weights or use collaborative TMLE that incorporates selection bias correction).

* If a formal transport analysis is not feasible due to lack of external data, we will qualitatively discuss generalizability. We'll identify factors that could limit transportability (e.g., our study is urban hospitals ‚Äì effect might differ in rural settings with different care practices). We will also explore whether the effect varies by any characteristic that also differs between populations (for instance, if effect is larger in younger patients and our sample is younger than the general population, the general population effect might be smaller).

* We will follow reporting guidelines for external validity by documenting the target population, what assumptions would be needed for transport (e.g., no unmeasured effect modifiers), and any evidence we have on those. If possible, a small validation analysis on an external dataset will be attempted to see if applying our model or effect estimation gives similar results.

By addressing external validity, we acknowledge that a causal effect is specific to a context. Our aim is to provide a reasoned argument for whether the thesis findings are likely to apply broadly or only to similar settings as our study. Any transportability claims will be backed by either analytical adjustment or a clear theoretical rationale.

## **Causal Quality Assurance Framework**

Throughout the analysis pipeline, we implement a **Causal Quality Assurance (QA) checklist** to uphold the validity and reproducibility of our results. This checklist is integrated at each phase:

* **Data QA**: Ensure data integrity before analysis.

  * Verify exposure and outcome timing (no immortal time bias, correct temporal ordering).

  * Check for data inconsistencies (e.g., dates out of order, duplicate entries).

  * Validate that all confounders are measured before exposure assignment.

  * Perform descriptive stats and visualize distributions for anomalies.

  * If multiple data sources, cross-verify key fields (e.g., outcome code appears in clinical notes?).

* **Design Assumption QA**: Cross-check that our study design meets causal assumptions.

  * Exchangeability: Review literature for potential confounders we might have missed; consult with domain experts to identify any unknown common causes.

  * Positivity: After propensity score estimation, confirm no extreme probabilities ~0 or ~1 for exposure given covariates; address any violations by trimming or re-defining groups.

  * SUTVA: Ensure one individual's exposure doesn't affect another's outcome (e.g., no interference); if interference is possible (like contagion in infectious disease), acknowledge and possibly adjust (not likely in our scenario).

  * Consistency: Ensure the exposure is well-defined such that all individuals under "treated" have a comparable intervention. If treatment protocols varied, consider defining exposure more granularly or using an instrumental variable approach.

* **Statistical Analysis QA**: Rigorous checks during modeling.

  * Propensity model QA: Assess multicollinearity, separation issues in logistic PS model; use diagnostics to ensure model convergence. If using ML for PS, use cross-validation and check variable importance to detect any unexpected drivers.

  * Outcome model QA: For parametric models, inspect residuals, influential points; for ML models, evaluate performance (e.g., if using cross-validated predictive error as a guide) to ensure they are reasonable representations.

  * Weight QA: After IPTW, check weight distribution (mean of weights ~1, no excessive skew). Document if any individuals carry very large weight and assess their influence via jackknife or influence analysis (dropping them to see impact).

  * Code QA: Use version control and peer code review (if possible). Before finalizing results, run a **reproducibility check** by independent re-running of the analysis pipeline (possibly on a subset or simulated data). Use unit tests for custom functions (e.g., a function that computes E-values) to ensure correctness.

  * Randomness control: Set random seeds for any resampling or ML training to ensure results are replicable.

* **Results QA and Interpretation**: Before drawing conclusions, validate that results make sense.

  * Double-check that the direction of effect is as hypothesized and magnitudes are plausible (e.g., compare an ATE with known effects from literature or a randomized trial if available).

  * **Placebo tests**: If possible, test a scenario where no effect is expected (e.g., an outcome known to be unaffected by exposure, or using future exposure to predict past outcome as a negative control) to ensure no spurious causal signal is detected.

  * Ensure that confidence intervals and p-values are consistent across methods (no contradictions in significance that aren't explained).

  * Check subgroup results for consistency: if an interaction is found, confirm it by multiple methods (interaction term in regression vs. causal forest partial dependence).

  * **Documentation**: Keep detailed log of all analyses performed. Any post-hoc decisions (though we minimize those by pre-specification) must be reported transparently.

* **Reporting and Transparency**: We will adhere to reporting guidelines like STROBE for observational studies, and specifically report all components relevant to causal analysis: assumptions, limitations, sensitivity analyses, and how each potential bias was addressed. The methods section (this blueprint) itself will be part of that transparency, laying out in advance how data will be handled and analyses conducted.

This Causal QA framework serves as a safeguard against common pitfalls. By embedding quality checks and validation at each step, we aim to produce findings that are reliable and credible for decision-making. In summary, the enhanced methods incorporate rigorous design, state-of-the-art causal inference techniques, and extensive diagnostics ‚Äì all justified by the literature and tailored to the context ‚Äì to ensure that the conclusions in the thesis stand on solid ground.

Below is a **single, unified "v2.0" Methods Blueprint** that merges your original SSD plan with every validated enhancement we discussed.  
 All earlier file names, Git/DVC hooks, and week numbers stay intact, so you can drop-in-replace the prior document without breaking links or automation. Added items are üîπblue and clearly scoped.

1. **No scope creep:** Only one extra robustness notebook \+ two lightweight estimator scripts; compute fits on available GPU/CPU.

2. **Causal transparency:** Observed-covariate E-values, negative controls, segmented COVID adjustment, competing-risk model.

3. **Estimator triangulation:** TMLE (primary), DML, causal forest, BART/X-learner‚Äîpre-registered reconciliation rule.

4. **Reproducibility:** Same Make/DVC contract; new dependencies pinned in Docker.

5. **Clinical & policy value:** Flag \+ severity power EMR banner; transportability step informs provincial scaling.

Run end-to-end:

## Methods Narrative (addendum)

*Data after 31 Dec 2020 are excluded due to increased data quality concerns and policy-driven changes in healthcare delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic, which could introduce bias or drift unrelated to the study exposure.*

All high-impact and medium reviewer concerns are now addressed in this blueprint as planned/documented steps. Implementation status is tracked above.

## Checklist enforcement
- After each script, tick and timestamp the corresponding item in `Final 3.1 plan and prgress.md`.
- CI will fail if any boxes remain unchecked when `make reporting` is run on `main`.

## **Next Actions Required (May 25, 2025)**

### ‚úÖ **Decision Finalized**
The team reviewed validation results and confirmed OR logic as the exposure definition on May 25, 2025.

### üìã **Technical Steps**
1. **Set up Python environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **If switching to AND logic**, modify line 345 in `02_exposure_flag.py`:
   ```python
   exposure["exposure_flag"] = exposure["exposure_flag_strict"]
   ```

3. **Execute remaining pipeline** (2-3 hours):
   - 07_missing_data.py
   - 07_referral_sequence.py
   - 07a_misclassification_adjust.py
   - 08_patient_master_table.py
   - 05_ps_match.py (GPU required)
   - 06_causal_estimators.py
   - Remaining scripts...

### üìä **Expected Challenges**
- With AND logic: Only 199 exposed vs 256,547 unexposed (power concerns) [Source: 02_exposure_flag.log]
- With OR logic: Heterogeneous exposure group may dilute effects [Statistical consideration]
- GPU memory constraints for propensity score matching [Hardware: 6GB GPU per config.yaml environment spec]
- Autoencoder performance below target (0.588 vs 0.83 AUROC) [Source: 03_mediator_autoencoder.log vs blueprint spec]
