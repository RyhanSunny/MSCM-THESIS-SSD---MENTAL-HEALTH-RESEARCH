# Clinical Validation Request - SSD Research Project

**Date**: June 21, 2025  
**PI**: Ryhan Suny  
**Deadline**: Within 1 week if possible

## What We Need From You

We need clinical expert validation of key parameters for our Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD) research pipeline. The technical analysis is complete, but we cannot proceed without your clinical validation.

---

## 1. SSD Phenotype Validation (MOST CRITICAL - 2 hours)

**What to do**:
1. We will send you a spreadsheet with 200 patient records
2. For each patient, review their:
   - Lab results (normal/abnormal patterns)
   - Symptom complaints (ICD codes provided)
   - Medication history
   - Referral patterns

**Question to answer**: Based on clinical judgment, does this patient have SSD? (Yes/No/Uncertain)

**Why this matters**: We need to calculate the true sensitivity and specificity of our SSD detection algorithm. Currently using literature values (82%/82%) which may not apply to our population.

---

## 2. Drug Persistence Threshold (30 minutes)

**Current threshold**: 180 days of continuous anxiolytic/hypnotic use

**Questions**:
1. Is 180 days clinically appropriate for defining "persistent use" in SSD patients?
2. Should this vary by drug class?
   - Anxiolytics (N05B): _____ days
   - Hypnotics (N05C): _____ days  
   - Antidepressants (N06A): _____ days
   - Anticonvulsants (N03A): _____ days

**Why this matters**: Determines which patients we classify as having medication-related SSD patterns.

## 3. Mental Health ICD Code Review (30 minutes)

**Please review our code mappings**:

```
Depression: F32, F33, F34, 296.2, 296.3
Anxiety: F40, F41, F42, 300.0*
PTSD: F43, 308.*, 309.*
Bipolar: F31, 296.0, 296.1, 296.4
```

**Questions**:
1. Are we missing important codes?
2. Are any codes inappropriate for SSD research?
3. What about adjustment disorders or other relevant conditions?

---

## 4. Healthcare Utilization Thresholds (30 minutes)

**Current definitions**:
- High utilization: >75th percentile of visits
- Frequent ED use: >3 visits/year
- Specialist referral loops: ≥2 referrals to same specialty

**Questions**:
1. Are these thresholds clinically meaningful for SSD?
2. What utilization pattern best identifies inappropriate healthcare seeking?
3. Should we consider visit reasons/urgency?

---

## 5. Normal Lab Definition (30 minutes)

**Current approach**: Labs within reference range = "normal"

**Questions**:
1. Should we consider borderline results differently?
2. Are there specific labs more relevant to SSD (e.g., inflammatory markers)?
3. How many normal labs indicate "excessive testing"? (Currently using ≥3)

## How to Provide Feedback

Please complete the attached validation form or provide responses via email with:
- Your clinical reasoning for each decision
- Any additional considerations we should incorporate
- Suggestions for improving our definitions

## Why This Matters

Your validation will:
- Enable analysis of 352,161 real patient records
- Ensure clinical validity of our findings
- Support publication in peer-reviewed journals
- Guide mental health resource allocation decisions

Without your validation, we cannot proceed with the analysis or publication.

Thank you for your time and expertise.
