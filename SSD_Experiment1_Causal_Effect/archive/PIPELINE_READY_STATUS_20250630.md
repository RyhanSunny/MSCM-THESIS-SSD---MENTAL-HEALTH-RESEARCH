# Pipeline Ready Status - June 30, 2025

## ✅ Pipeline is READY for Full Execution

All reviewer feedback has been addressed and the pipeline is ready to run from scratch.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clean any previous outputs
make clean-data

# 2. Run the complete pipeline
make all

# This will run all steps including:
# - Cohort construction
# - Feature extraction (exposure, mediator, outcomes, confounders)
# - Pre-imputation master table creation (NEW)
# - Multiple imputation with m=30 (NEW)
# - Propensity score matching/weighting
# - Causal estimation on all imputations
# - Rubin's Rules pooling with Barnard-Rubin adjustment
# - All sensitivity analyses and reports
```

## What Has Changed

### Critical Improvements
1. **Pipeline Order Fixed**: Now imputes on full 73-column dataset (not just 19-column cohort)
2. **Rubin's Rules Enhanced**: Added Barnard-Rubin small-sample df adjustment
3. **30 Imputations**: Increased from 5 to properly handle 28% missing data
4. **Weight Trimming**: Implemented Crump rule for extreme weights
5. **ESS Formula Fixed**: Corrected calculation for weight diagnostics
6. **Git Tracking**: All outputs now include SHA and timestamp

### New Files Created
- `src/pre_imputation_master.py` - Merges features BEFORE imputation
- `src/07b_missing_data_master.py` - Imputes full master table
- `src/imputed_causal_pipeline.py` - Runs analysis on all imputations
- `src/rubins_pooling_helper.py` - Helper functions (<50 lines)
- `src/weight_diagnostics_visualizer.py` - ESS and balance checks

### Updated Files
- `src/08_patient_master_table.py` - Now uses imputed data
- `src/06_causal_estimators.py` - Added weight trimming
- `src/rubins_pooling_engine.py` - Barnard-Rubin adjustment
- `Makefile` - New targets for imputation workflow

## Expected Outputs

After running `make all`, you will have:

```

## Computation Time Estimates

Based on the data size (256,746 patients) and hardware:
- Pre-imputation master: ~5 minutes
- Multiple imputation (m=30): ~45-60 minutes
- PS matching: ~10 minutes
- Causal estimation (30 datasets): ~30 minutes
- Rubin's pooling: ~2 minutes
- **Total**: ~2-3 hours for complete pipeline

## Verification Steps

After pipeline completes:

1. **Check imputation worked**:
   ```bash
   ls -la data_derived/imputed_master/master_imputed_*.parquet | wc -l
   # Should show 30 files
   ```

2. **Check pooled results exist**:
   ```bash
   cat results/pooled_causal_estimates.json | jq .
   # Should show ATE with CI and Barnard-Rubin df
   ```

3. **Verify git tracking**:
   ```bash
   grep "git_sha" results/study_documentation_*.yaml
   # Should show git commit hash
   ```

4. **Check ESS**:
   ```bash
   cat results/weight_diagnostics.json | jq .effective_sample_size
   # Should be >80% of matched sample
   ```

## Notes

- All code follows CLAUDE.md TDD requirements
- Functions refactored to <50 lines
- Comprehensive test coverage added
- MC-SIMEX variance limitation documented
- Pipeline fully reproducible with Docker

## Support

If any issues arise during execution:
1. Check logs in individual script log files
2. Verify Python environment has all packages
3. Ensure sufficient disk space for imputations
4. See IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY_20250630.md for details
