# SSD Experiment 1 Causal Effect Pipeline - Validation Report

**Date**: June 17, 2025  
**Prepared by**: Claude AI Assistant  
**Status**: Production Validation Complete with Critical Findings

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive validation of the SSD Experiment 1 Causal Effect Pipeline has been completed, examining all implementations against the requirements specified in CLAUDE.md, SSD THESIS final METHODOLOGIES blueprint, and JUNE-16-MAX-EVAL.md. While the pipeline demonstrates sophisticated technical implementation with 85% production readiness, several critical blockers prevent immediate production use.

### Key Findings

**‚úÖ Successfully Implemented (Weeks 1-5)**
- All core causal inference components are functional
- Mental health domain alignment achieved (ICD filtering, 180-day persistence)
- Advanced statistical methods implemented (TMLE, DML, Causal Forest)
- Comprehensive documentation and visualization pipeline complete
- Robust CI/CD integration with quality gates

**‚ö†Ô∏è Week 6 (Prompt 8) Partial Implementation**
- MC-SIMEX integration: ‚úÖ Functional but using placeholder values
- SHAP explanations: ‚úÖ Implemented with graceful degradation
- Autoencoder: ‚ö†Ô∏è Only achieves AUROC 0.588 (target: 0.70)
- MSM smoke test: ‚ö†Ô∏è Data exists but runner scripts missing
- OSF upload: ‚ö†Ô∏è Stub implementation only

**üö® Critical Production Blockers**
1. **MC-SIMEX Placeholder Values**: Using literature-based sensitivity/specificity (0.82/0.82) instead of validated metrics
2. **ICES External Data**: Fabricated demographic marginals for transport weights
3. **Full Dataset Integration**: Only tested on checkpoint samples, not full 250,000+ patient dataset
4. **Clinical Validation Missing**: No expert review of phenotype definitions or code mappings

### 2. Clinical Validation Gaps

#### Critical Issues Requiring Human Expert Review:

1. **Phenotype Validation**
   - Current: Placeholder sensitivity/specificity from literature
   - Required: 200-patient chart review by clinical expert
   - Impact: All bias correction calculations potentially invalid

2. **Code Mapping Validation**
   - Issue: Only 17 NYD referral codes found (expected more)
   - Required: Psychiatrist review of ICD-9/10 mappings
   - Impact: H2 hypothesis (referral loops) may be underpowered

3. **Laboratory Thresholds**
   - Current: Using standard reference ranges
   - Required: Clinical validation for mental health population
   - Impact: H1 hypothesis (normal labs) accuracy uncertain

4. **Drug Class Definitions**
   - Current: N06A, N03A, N05A classes included
   - Required: Pharmacist review of psychiatric medications
   - Impact: H3 hypothesis (drug persistence) completeness

### 3. Data Integration Status

#### Production Data Requirements:
- **Current**: Using checkpoint_1_20250318_024427 sample data
- **Required**: Full CPCSSN dataset (250,025+ patients)
- **Missing**: Performance validation at production scale
- **Risk**: Unknown memory/compute requirements for full dataset

#### External Validity Data:
- **Current**: Fabricated ICES marginals in CSV
- **Required**: Real Ontario population demographics
- **Alternative**: Document as limitation if data unavailable

2. **Computational Scale**: Full dataset may exceed current resources
3. **External Data Access**: ICES data sharing agreement uncertain

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. Begin expert recruitment immediately
2. Reserve high-memory compute resources
3. Prepare manuscript with/without external validation

## Budget Estimates

### Expert Consultation Costs:
- Clinical Expert (40 hours @ $150/hr): $6,000
- Biostatistician (20 hours @ $125/hr): $2,500
- Pharmacist (10 hours @ $100/hr): $1,000
- **Total**: $9,500

### Compute Resources:
- High-memory instance (2 weeks): $500-1,000
- Storage for full dataset: $200
- **Total**: $700-1,200

## Conclusion

The SSD Experiment 1 Causal Effect Pipeline represents a sophisticated and well-engineered framework for mental health research. However, it currently operates with several placeholder values and assumptions that prevent immediate production use. 

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 clinical validation immediately. The pipeline cannot be used for publication or clinical decision-making until all Priority 1 blockers are resolved with real data and expert validation.

**Timeline**: 4-6 weeks to production readiness with dedicated resources.

**Success Criteria**: 
- All placeholder values replaced with validated metrics
- Full dataset integration tested and performant
- Clinical expert sign-off on all assumptions
- Comprehensive documentation of any remaining limitations
